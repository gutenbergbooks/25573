    <h2>
      THE INVISIBLE CONFLICT
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Maeterlinck has lately propounded the theory {*} that what we call the
      war is neither more nor less than the visible expression of a vast
      invisible conflict. The unseen forces of good and evil in the universe are
      using man as a means of contention. On the result of the struggle the
      destiny of humanity on this planet depends. Is the Angel to prevail? Or is
      the Beast to prolong his malignant existence? The issue hangs on Fate,
      which does not, however, deny the exercise of the will of man. Mystical
      and even fantastic as the theory may seem to be, there is no resisting its
      appeal. A glance back over the events of the past year leaves us again and
      again without clue to cause and effect. It is impossible to account for so
      many things that have happened. We cannot always say, &ldquo;We did this because
      of that,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Our enemies did that because of the other.&rdquo; Time after time
      we can find no reason why things happened as they have&mdash;so
      unaccountable and so contradictory have they seemed to be. The dark work
      wrought by Death during the past year has been done in the blackness of a
      night in which none can read. Hence some of us are forced to yield to Mr.
      Maeterlinck&rsquo;s theory, which is, I think, the theory of the ancients&mdash;the
      theory on which the Greeks built their plays&mdash;that invisible powers
      of good and evil, operating in regions that are above and beyond man&rsquo;s
      control, are working out his destiny in this monstrous drama of the war.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The Daily Chronicle.
</pre>
    <p>
      And what a drama it has been already! We had witnessed only 365 days of it
      down to August 4, 1915, corresponding at the utmost to perhaps three of
      its tragic acts, but what scenes, what emotions! Mr. Lowell used to say
      that to read Carlyle&rsquo;s book on the French Revolution was to see history as
      by flashes of lightning. It is only as by flashes of lightning that we can
      yet hope to see the world-drama of 1914-15. Figures, groups, incidents,
      episodes, without the connecting links of plots, and just as they have
      been thrown off by Time, the master-producer&mdash;what a spectacle they
      make, what a medley of motives, what a confused jumble of sincerities and
      hypocrisies, heroisms and brutalities, villainies and virtues!
    </p>
    <p>
      As happens in every drama, a great deal of the tragic mischief had
      occurred before the curtain rose. Always before the passage of war over
      the world there comes the far-off murmur of its approaching wings. Each of
      us in this case had heard it, distinctly or indistinctly, according to the
      accidents of personal experience. I think I myself heard it for the first
      time dearly when in the closing year of King Edward&rsquo;s reign I came to know
      (it is unnecessary to say how) what our Sovereign&rsquo;s feeling had been about
      his last visit to Berlin. It can do no harm now to say that it had been a
      feeling of intense anxiety. The visit seemed necessary, even imperative,
      there-fore the King would not shirk his duty. But for his country, as well
      as for himself, he had feared for his reception in Germany, and on his
      arrival in Berlin, and during his drive from the railway station with the
      Kaiser, he had watched and listened to the demonstrations in the streets
      with an emotion which very nearly amounted to dread.
    </p>
    <p>
      The result had brought a certain relief. With the best of all possible
      intentions, the newspapers in both capitals had reported that King
      Edward&rsquo;s reception had been enthusiastic. It hadn&rsquo;t been that&mdash;at
      least, it hadn&rsquo;t seemed to be that to the persons chiefly concerned. But
      it had been just cordial enough not to be chilling, just warm enough to
      carry things off, to drown that far-off murmur of war which was like the
      approach of a mighty wind. Then, during the next days, there had been the
      usual banqueting, with the customary toasting to the amity of the two
      great nations, whose interests were so closely united by bonds of peace!
      And then the return drive to the railway station, the clatter of horsemen
      in shining armour, the adieux, the throbbing of the engine, the starting
      of the train, and then.... &ldquo;Thank God, it&rsquo;s over!&rdquo; If the invisible powers
      had really been struggling over the destiny of men, how the evil half of
      them must have shrieked with delight that day as the Kaiser rode back to
      Potsdam and our King returned to London!

    <h2>
      PEN-PORTRAIT OF THE KAISER
    </h2>
    <p>
      Other whisperings there were of the storm that was so soon to burst on the
      world. In the ominous silence there were rumours of a certain change that
      was coming over the spirit of the Kaiser. For long years he had been
      credited with a sincere love of peace, and a ceaseless desire to restrain
      the forces about him that were making for war. Although constantly
      occupied with the making of a big army, and inspiring it with great
      ideals, he was thought to have as little desire for actual warfare as his
      ancestor, Frederick William, had shown, while gathering up his giant
      guardsmen and refusing to allow them to fight. Particularly it was
      believed in Berlin (not altogether graciously) that his affection for, and
      even fear of his grandmother, Queen Victoria, would compel him to exhaust
      all efforts to preserve peace in the event of trouble with Great Britain.
      But Victoria was dead, and King Edward might perhaps be smiled at&mdash;behind
      his back&mdash;and then a younger generation was knocking at the Kaiser&rsquo;s
      door in the person of his eldest son, who represented forces which he
      might not long be able to hold in check. How would he act now?
    </p>
    <p>
      Thousands of persons in this country had countless opportunities before
      the war of forming an estimate of the Kaiser&rsquo;s character. I had only one,
      and it was not of the best. For years the English traveller abroad felt as
      if he were always following in the track of a grandiose personality who
      was playing on the scene of the world as on a stage, fond as an actor of
      dressing up in fine uniforms, of making pictures, scenes, and impressions,
      and leaving his visible mark behind him&mdash;as in the case of the huge
      gap in the thick walls of Jerusalem, torn down (it was said with his
      consent) to let his equipage pass through.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Rome I saw a man who was a true son of his ancestors. Never had the
      laws of heredity better justified themselves. Frederick William, Frederick
      the Great, William the First&mdash;the Hohenzollerns were all there. The
      glittering eyes, the withered arm, the features that gave signs of
      frightful periodical pain, the immense energy, the gigantic egotism, the
      ravenous vanity, the fanaticism amounting to frenzy, the dominating power,
      the dictatorial temper, the indifference to suffering (whether his own or
      other people&rsquo;s), the overbearing suppression of opposing opinions, the
      determination to control everybody&rsquo;s interest, everybody&rsquo;s work&mdash;I
      thought all this was written in the Kaiser&rsquo;s masterful face. Then came
      stories. One of my friends in Rome was an American doctor who had been
      called to attend a lady of the Emperor&rsquo;s household. &ldquo;Well, doctor, what&rsquo;s
      she suffering from?&rdquo; said the Kaiser. The doctor told him. &ldquo;Nothing of the
      kind&mdash;you&rsquo;re entirely wrong. She&rsquo;s suffering from so and so,&rdquo; said
      the Majesty of Germany, stamping up and down the room. At length the
      American doctor lost control. &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;in my country we have a
      saying that one bad practitioner is worth twenty good amateurs&mdash;you&rsquo;re
      the amateur.&rdquo; The doctor lived through it. Frederick William would have
      dragged him to the window and tried to fling him out of it. William II put
      his arm round the doctor&rsquo;s shoulder and said, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to hurt you,
      old fellow. Let us sit down and talk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A soldier came with another story. After a sham fight conducted by the
      Kaiser the generals of the German army had been summoned to say what they
      thought of the Royal manoeuvres. All had formed an unfavourable opinion,
      yet one after another, with some insincere compliment, had wriggled out of
      the difficulty of candid criticism. But at length came an officer, who
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sir, if it had been real warfare to-day there wouldn&rsquo;t be enough wood in
      Germany to make coffins for the men who would be dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The general lived through it, too&mdash;at first in a certain disfavour,
      but afterwards in recovered honour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the Kaiser, who a year ago had to meet the mighty wind of War. He
      was in Norway for his usual summer holiday in July 1914 when affairs were
      reaching their crisis. Rumour has it that he was not satisfied with the
      measure of the information that was reaching him, therefore he returned to
      Berlin, somewhat to the discomfiture of his ministers, intending, it is
      said, for various reasons (not necessarily humanitarian) to stop or at
      least postpone the war. If so, he arrived too late. He was told that
      matters had gone too far. They must go on now. &ldquo;Very well, if they must,
      they must,&rdquo; he is reported to have said. And there is the familiar story
      that after he had signed his name on the first of August to the document
      that plunged Europe into the conflict that has since shaken it to its
      foundations, he flung down his pen and cried, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll live to regret this,
      gentlemen.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      PEN-PORTRAIT OF THE CROWN PRINCE
    </h2>
    <p>
      And then the Crown Prince. In August of last year nine out of every ten of
      us would have said that not the father, but the son, of the Royal family
      of Germany had been the chief provocative cause of the war. Subsequent
      events have lessened the weight of that opinion. But the young man&rsquo;s known
      popularity among an active section of the officers of the army; their
      subterranean schemes to set him off against his father; a vague suspicion
      of the Kaiser&rsquo;s jealousy of his eldest son&mdash;all these facts and
      shadows of facts give colour to the impression that not least among the
      forces which led the Emperor on that fateful first of August to declare
      war against Russia was the presence and the importunity of the Crown
      Prince. What kind of man was it, then, whom the invisible powers of evil
      were employing to precipitate this insensate struggle?
    </p>
    <p>
      Hundreds of persons in England, France, Russia, and Italy must have met
      the Crown Prince of Germany at more or less close quarters, and formed
      their own estimates of his character. The barbed-wire fence of protective
      ceremony which usually surrounds Royal personages, concealing their little
      human foibles, was periodically broken down in the case of the
      Heir-Apparent to the German Throne by his incursion every winter into a
      small cosmopolitan community which repaired to the snows of the Engadine
      for health or pleasure. In that stark environment I myself, in common with
      many others, saw the descendant of the Fredericks every day, for several
      weeks of several years, at a distance that called for no intellectual
      field-glasses. And now I venture to say, for whatever it may be worth,
      that the result was an entirely unfavourable impression.
    </p>
    <p>
      I saw a young man without a particle of natural distinction, whether
      physical, moral, or mental. The figure, long rather than tall; the hatchet
      face, the selfish eyes, the meaningless mouth, the retreating forehead,
      the vanishing chin, the energy that expressed itself merely in restless
      movement, achieving little, and often aiming at nothing at all; the
      uncultivated intellect, the narrow views of life and the world; the morbid
      craving for change, for excitement of any sort; the indifference to other
      people&rsquo;s feelings, the shockingly bad manners, the assumption of a right
      to disregard and even to outrage the common conventions on which social
      intercourse depends&mdash;all this was, so far as my observation enabled
      me to judge, only too plainly apparent in the person of the Crown Prince.
      21
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside the narrow group that gathered about him (a group hailing,
      ironically enough, from the land of a great Republic) I cannot remember to
      have heard in any winter one really warm word about him, one story of an
      act of kindness, or even generous condescension, such as it is easy for a
      royal personage to perform. On the contrary, I was constantly hearing
      tales of silly fooleries, of overbearing behaviour, of deliberate
      rudeness, such as irresistibly recalled, in spirit if not in form, the
      conduct of the common barrator in the guise of a king, who, if Macaulay&rsquo;s
      stories are to be credited, used to kick a lady in the open streets and
      tell her to go home and mind her brats.

    <h2>
      SOME SALUTARY LESSONS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Only it was not Prussia we were living in, and it was not the year 1720,
      so the air tingled occasionally with other tales of little salutary
      lessons administered to our Royal upstart on his style of pursuing the
      pleasures considered suitable to a Prince. One day it was told of him
      that, having given a cup to be raced for on the Bob-run, he was wroth to
      find on the notice-board of entries the names of a team of highly
      respectable little Englishmen who are familiar on the racecourse; and,
      taking out his pencil-case, he scored them off, saying, &ldquo;My cup is for
      gentlemen, not jockeys,&rdquo; whereupon a young English soldier standing by had
      said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not jockeys here, sir, and we&rsquo;re not princes; we are only
      sportsmen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I cannot vouch for that story, but I can certainly say that, after a
      particularly flagrant and deliberate act of rudeness, imperilling the
      safety of several persons in the village street, the Crown Prince of
      Germany was told to his foolish face by an Englishman, who need not be
      named, that he was a fool, and a damned fool, and deserved to be kicked
      off the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      And this is the mindless, but mischievous, person, the ridiculous
      buccaneer, born out of his century, who was permitted to interfere in the
      destinies of Europe; to help to determine the fate of tens of millions of
      men on the battlefields, and the welfare of hundreds of millions of women
      and children in their homes. What wild revel the invisible powers of evil
      must have held in Berlin on that night of August 1, 1914, after the Kaiser
      had thrown down his pen!

    <h2>
      PEN-PORTRAIT OF THE ARCHDUKE FERDINAND
    </h2>
    <p>
      Then the Archduke Ferdinand of Austro-Hungary, whose assassination was the
      ostensible cause of this devastating war&mdash;what kind of man was he?
      Quite a different person from the Crown Prince, and yet, so far as I could
      judge, just as little worthy of the appalling sacrifice of human life
      which his death has occasioned. Not long before his tragic end I spent a
      month under the same roof with him, and though the house was only an
      hotel, it was situated in a remote place, and though I was not in any
      sense of the Archduke&rsquo;s party, I walked and talked frequently with most of
      the members of it, and so, with the added help of daily observation, came
      to certain conclusions about the character of the principal personage.
    </p>
    <p>
      A middle-aged man, stiff-set, heavy-jawed, with a strong step, and a short
      manner; obviously proud, reserved, silent, slightly imperious,
      self-centred, self-opinionated, well-educated in the kind of knowledge all
      such men must possess, but narrow in intellect, retrograde in sympathy, a
      stickler for social conventions, an almost unyielding upholder of royal
      rights, prerogatives, customs, and usages (although by his own marriage he
      had violated one of the first of the laws of his class, and by his
      unfailing fidelity to his wife continued to resist it), superstitious
      rather than religious, an immense admirer of the Kaiser, and a decidedly
      hostile critic of our own country&mdash;such was the general impression
      made on one British observer by the Archduke Ferdinand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man is dead; he took no part in the war, except unwittingly by the act
      of dying, and therefore one could wish to speak of him with respect and
      restraint. Otherwise it might be possible to justify this estimate of his
      character by the narration of little incidents, and one such, though
      trivial in itself, may perhaps bear description. The younger guests of the
      hotel in the mountains had got up a fancy dress ball, and among persons
      clad in all conceivable costumes, including those of monks, cardinals, and
      even popes, a lady of demure manners, who did not dance, had come
      downstairs in the habit of a nun. This aroused the superstitious
      indignation of the Archduke, who demanded that the lady should retire from
      the room instantly, or he would order his carriage and leave the hotel at
      once.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, the inevitable happened&mdash;the Archduke&rsquo;s will became law,
      and the lady went upstairs in tears, while I and two or three others
      (Catholics among us) thought and said, &ldquo;Heaven help Europe when the time
      comes for its destinies to depend largely on the judgment of a man whose
      be-muddled intellect cannot distinguish between morality of the real world
      and of an entirely fantastic and fictitious one.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      ONE OF THE OLDEST, FEEBLEST, AND LEAST CAPABLE OF MEN
    </h2>
    <p>
      That time, as we now know, never came, but a still more fatal time did
      come&mdash;the cruel, ironical, and sinister time of July 28, 1914, when
      one of the oldest, feeblest, and least capable of living men, the Emperor
      of Austria, under the pretence of avenging the death of the
      heir-presumptive to his throne, signed with his trembling hand, which
      could scarcely hold the pen, the first of his many proclamations of war,
      and so touched the button of the monstrous engine that set Europe aflame.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Archduke Ferdinand was foully done to death in discharging a patriotic
      duty, but to think that the penalty imposed on the world for the
      assassination of a man of his calibre and capacity for usefulness (or yet
      for the violation of the principles of public safety, thereby involved)
      has been the murdering of millions of men of many nationalities, the
      destruction of an entire kingdom, the burning of historic cities, the
      impoverishment of the rich and the starvation of the poor, the outraging
      of women and the slaughter of children, is also to think that for the past
      365 days the destinies of humanity have been controlled by demons, who
      must be shrieking with laughter at the stupidities of mankind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thank God, we are not required to think anything quite so foolish,
      although we can not escape from a conclusion almost equally degrading.
      Victor Hugo used to say that only kings desired war, and that with the
      celebration of the United States of Europe we should see the beginning of
      the golden age of Peace. But the events of the tremendous days from July
      28 to August 4,1914, show us with humiliating distinctness that though
      Kaisers, Emperors, Crown Princes, and Archdukes may be the accidental
      instruments of invisible powers in plunging humanity into seas of blood, a
      war is no sooner declared by any of them, however feeble or fatuous, than
      all the nations concerned make it their own. That was what happened in
      Central Europe the moment Austria declared war on Serbia, and the history
      of man on this planet has no record of anything more pitiful than the
      spectacle of Germany&mdash;&ldquo;sincere, calm, deep-thinking Germany,&rdquo; as
      Carlyle called her, whose triumph in 1870 was &ldquo;the hopefullest fact&rdquo; of
      his time&mdash;stifling her conscience in order to justify her
      participation in the conflict.

      &ldquo;Stand aside in a benevolent neutrality, and we undertake not to take any

      iniquity of asking us to trade with her in the French colonies. And when
      we rejected Germany&rsquo;s infamous proposals, and called on her to say if she
      meant to respect the independence of Belgium, whose integrity we had
      mutually pledged ourselves to protect, her Chancellor stamped and fumed at

    <h2>
      A GERMAN HIGH PRIEST OF PEACE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Nor did the theologians, publicists, and authors of Germany show a more
      sensitive conscience than her statesmen. One of the theologians was Adolf
      Harnack, professor of Church History in Berlin and intimate acquaintance
      of the Kaiser. Not long before the war he published a book entitled &ldquo;What
      is Christianity?&rdquo; which began with the words, &ldquo;John Stuart Mill used to
      say humanity could not be too often reminded that there was once a man
      named Socrates. That is true, but still more important it is to remind
      mankind that a man of the name of Jesus Christ once lived among them.&rdquo; On
      this text the Book proceeded to enforce the practical application of
      Christ&rsquo;s teaching to the modern world, and particularly to propound his
      doctrine of the wickedness and futility of violence, which led the author
      to the conclusion that it was &ldquo;not necessary for justice to use force in
      order to remain justice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Somewhat later Professor Harnack came to this country to attend, if I
      remember rightly, a World Missionary Conference at Edinburgh, and the
      memory of him which abides in our northern capital is that of a high
      priest and prophet of the new golden age that was dawning on the world&mdash;the
      age of universal brotherhood and peace. But no sooner had war come within
      the zone of Germany than this man signed (if he did not write) a manifesto
      of German theologians which told &ldquo;evangelical Christians abroad&rdquo; that the
      German &ldquo;sword was bright and keen,&rdquo; that Germany was taking up arms to
      establish the justice of her cause and that ever through the storm and
      horror of the coming conflict the German people, with a calm conscience,
      would kneel and pray: &ldquo;Hallowed be Thy name, Thy kingdom come, Thy will be
      done on earth as it is in Heaven.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      &ldquo;WE SHALL NEVER MASSACRE BELGIAN WOMEN&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p>
      One of the writers who performed the same kind of moral somersault was
      Gerhart Hauptmann, author of a Socialist drama called &ldquo;The Weavers,&rdquo; and,
      rumour says, protégé (what frightful irony!) of the Crown Prince,
      Hauptmann knew well (none better) that a vast proportion of the human
      family live perpetually on the borderland of want, and that of all who
      suffer by war the poor suffer most. Yet he wrote (and a degenerate son of
      the great Norwegian liberator, Bjôrnsen, published) a letter, in which,
      after telling the poor of his people that &ldquo;heaven alone knew&rdquo; why their
      enemies were assailing them, he called on them (in effect) to avenge
      unnameable atrocities, which he alleged, without a particle of proof, had
      been committed on innocent Germans living abroad, and then said, in
      allusion to Mr. Maeterlinck, &ldquo;I can assure him that, although &lsquo;barbarous
      Germans,&rsquo; we shall never be so cowardly as to massacre or martyr the
      Belgian women and children.&rdquo; This was written in August 1914, at the very
      hour, as the world now knows, when the German soldiers in Liège were
      shooting, bayoneting, and burning alive old men and little children,
      raping nuns in their convents and young girls in the open streets. But the
      invisible powers of evil have no mercy on their instruments after they
      have worked their will, and Time has turned them into objects of contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor were the German people themselves, any more than their master-spirits
      and spokesmen, spared the shame of their duplicity in those early days of
      August 1914. A large group of them, including commercial and professional
      men, drew up a long address to the neutral countries, in which they said
      that down to the eleventh hour they had &ldquo;never dreamt of war,&rdquo; never
      thought of depriving other nations of light and air or of thrusting
      anybody from his place. And yet the ink of their protest was not yet dry
      when they gave themselves the lie by showing that down to the last detail
      of preparation they had everything ready for the forthcoming struggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Englishmen who were in Berlin and Cologne on July 81, and August 1 (before
      any of the nations had declared war on Germany), could see what was
      happening, though no telegrams or newspapers had yet made known the news.
      A tingling atmosphere of joyous expectation in the streets; the cafés and
      beer-gardens crowded with civilians in soldiers&rsquo; uniforms; orchestras
      striking up patriotic anthems; excited groups singing &ldquo;Deutschland über
      Alles,&rdquo; or rising to their feet and jingling glasses; then the lights put
      out, and a general rush made for the railway stations&mdash;everybody
      equipped, and knowing his duty and his destination.

    <h2>
      THE OLD GERMAN ADAM
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was the old historic story of German duplicity, and the nations of
      Europe had no excuse for being surprised. When the Prussian Monarchy was
      first bestowed on the relatively humble family of the Höhenzollerns, they
      found their territory for the most part sterile, the soil round Berlin and
      about Potsdam&mdash;the favourite residence of the Margraves&mdash;a sandy
      desert that could scarcely be made to yield a crop of rye or oats, so they
      set themselves to enlarge and enrich it by help of an army out of all
      proportion to the size and importance of their States. The results were
      inevitable. When war becomes the trade of a separate class it is natural
      that they should wish to pursue it at the first favourable opportunity of
      conquest. That opportunity came to Prussia when Charles VI died and the
      Archduchess Maria Theresa succeeded to her father by virtue of a law (the
      Pragmatic Sanction), to which all the Powers of Europe had subscribed.
      Frederick had subscribed to it. But, nevertheless, in the name of Prussia,
      without any proper excuse or even decent pretext, he took possession of
      Silesia, thereby robbing the ally whom he had bound himself to defend, and
      committing the same great crime of violating his pledged word, which
      Germany has now committed against Belgium.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was one difference between the outrages of 1740 and 1914. The
      great barrator made no hypocritical pretence of desiring peace. &ldquo;Ambition,
      interest, the desire of making people talk about me carried the day, and I
      decided for war,&rdquo; he said. It was reserved for Harnack and Hauptmann, not
      to speak of the Kaiser, to cant about the responsibilities of &ldquo;Kul-tur&rdquo;
       (that harlot of the German dictionary, debased by all ignoble uses), about
      the hastening of the kingdom of heaven, and about the German sword being
      sanctified by God. But the old German Adam remained, and when, two days
      before the declaration of war with France, the German soldiers were flying
      to the Belgian frontier there was no thought of the Archduke Ferdinand or
      of the doddering old man on the Austrian throne, whose paternal heart had
      been sorely wounded. Germany was out to rob France of her colonies&mdash;to
      rob her, and the Germans knew it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A few centuries may have to run their course,&rdquo; said their own poet Goethe
      (who surely knew the German soul), &ldquo;before it can be said of the German
      people, &lsquo;It is a long time since they were barbarians.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Such, then, were some of the events in the great drama of the war which
      took place in Germany before the rising of the curtain. Not a theologian,
      a philosopher, an historian, or a poet to recall the past of his country,
      to warn it not to repeat the crime of a century and a half before, which
      had stained its name for ever before the tribunals of man and God; not a
      statesman to remind a generation that was too young to remember 1870 of
      the miseries and horrors of war, for (alas for the welfare of the world!)
      the one great German voice that could have done so with searching and
      scorching eloquence (the voice of Bebel) had only just been silenced by
      the grave. And so it came to pass that Germany, in the last days of July
      1914, presented the pitiful spectacle of a great nation being lured on to
      its moral death-agony amid canting appeals to the Almighty, and wild
      outbursts of popular joy.

    <h2>
      A CONVERSATION WITH LORD ROBERTS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Meantime what had been happening among ourselves? The far-off murmur of
      the approaching wind had been heard by all of us, but as none can hope to
      describe the effect on the whole Empire, perhaps each may be allowed to
      indicate the character of the warning as it came to his own ears. It was
      at Naples, not long after the event, that I heard how the late King had
      felt about his last visit to Berlin. I was then on my way home from Egypt,
      where I had spent some days at Mena, while Lord Roberts was staying there
      on his way back from the Soudan. He seemed restless and anxious. On two
      successive mornings I sat with him for a long hour in the shade of the
      terraces which overlook the Pyramids discussing the &ldquo;German danger.&rdquo; After
      the great soldier had left for Cairo he wrote asking me to regard our
      conversations as confidential; and down to this moment I have always done
      so, but I see no harm now (quite the reverse of harm) in repeating the
      substance of what he said so many years ago on a matter of such infinite
      momentousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you really attach importance to this scare of a German invasion?&rdquo; I
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I do,&rdquo; said Lord Roberts.
    </p>

      &ldquo;WE&rsquo;LL FIGHT AND FIGHT SOON&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p>
      By that time I had, in common with the majority of my countrymen who
      travelled much abroad, been compelled to recognize the ever-increasing
      hostility of the German and British peoples whenever they encountered each
      other on the highways of the world&mdash;their constant cross-purposes on
      steamships, in railway trains, hotels, casinos, post and telegraph offices&mdash;making
      social intercourse difficult and friendship impossible. The overbearing
      manners of many German travellers, their aggressive and domineering
      selfishness, which always demanded the best seats, the best rooms, and the
      first attention, was year by year becoming more and more intolerable to
      the British spirit. It cannot be said that we acquiesced. Indeed, it must
      be admitted that our country-people usually met the German claims to be
      the supermen of Europe with rather unnecessary self-assertion. If an
      unmannerly German pushed before us at the counter of a booking-office we
      pushed him back; if he shouted over our shoulders at a telegraph office we
      told him to hold his tongue; and if, in stiflingly hot weather, he
      insisted (as he often did) on shutting up again and again the window of a
      railway carriage after we had opened it for a breath of air, we sometimes
      drove our elbow through the glass for final answer&mdash;as I saw an
      English barrister do one choking day on the journey between Jaffa and
      Jerusalem.
    </p>
    <p>
      These were only the straws that told how the wind blew, but they were
      disquieting symptoms nevertheless to such of us as felt, with Professor
      Harnack and his colleagues at the Edinburgh Conference, that by blood,
      history, and faith the German and British peoples were brothers (ugly as
      it sounds to say so now), each more closely bound to the other in the
      world-task of civilization than with almost any other nation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we are brothers we&rsquo;ll fight all the more fiercely for that fact,&rdquo; we
      thought, &ldquo;and, God help us, we&rsquo;ll fight soon.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      &ldquo;HE KNOWS, DOESN&rsquo;T HE?&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p>
      I was staying in a neutral country at an hotel much frequented by the
      German governing classes when an English newspaper proprietor, after a
      visit to Berlin, published in his most popular journal a map of a portion
      of Northern Europe in order to show at sight his view of the extent of the
      forthcoming German aggression. The paper was lying open between a group of
      gentlemen whose names have since become prominent in relation to the war
      when I stepped up to the table. The men were obviously angry, although
      laughing immoderately. &ldquo;Look at that,&rdquo; said one of them, pointing to the
      map and running his finger down the coast of Holland and Belgium and
      France to Calais. &ldquo;<i>He</i> knows, doesn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then, after a general burst of derisive laughter, came a bitter attack
      on British journalism (&ldquo;The scaremongering of that paper is doing more
      than anything in the world to make war between Germany and England&rdquo;), a
      still fiercer and more bitter assault on our Lords of the Admiralty, who
      had lately proposed a year&rsquo;s truce in the building of battleships (&ldquo;Tell
      your Mr. Churchill to mind his own business, and we&rsquo;ll mind ours&rdquo;), and,
      finally, a passionate protest that Germany&rsquo;s object in increasing her navy
      was not to enlarge her empire, but merely to keep the seas open to her
      trade. &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said one of the men, &ldquo;nine-tenths of my own business is with
      London, and if England could shut up our ships I should be a ruined man in
      a month.&rdquo; &ldquo;Quite so,&rdquo; said another, &ldquo;and so far as German people go that&rsquo;s
      the beginning and end of the whole matter.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      WE BELIEVED IT
    </h2>
    <p>
      We believed it. I am compelled to count myself among the number of my
      countrymen who through many years believed that story&mdash;that the
      accident of Germany&rsquo;s disadvantageous geographical position, not her
      desire to break British supremacy on the sea, made it necessary for her to
      enlarge her navy. I did my best to believe it when I had to sail through
      the Kiel Canal in a steamer from Lubeck to Copenhagen, which was forced to
      shoulder her way through an ever-increasing swarm of German battleships. I
      did my best to believe it when I had to sail under the threatening
      fortresses of Heligoland which stood anchored out at the mouth of the
      Bight like a mastiff at the end of his chain snarling at the sea. I did my
      best to believe it when I had to travel to Cologne by night, and the
      darkened railway carriages were lit up by fierce flashes from gigantic
      furnaces which were making mountains of munitions for the evil day when
      frail man would have to face the murderous slaughter of machine-guns. I
      did my best to believe it even in Berlin when German friends of the
      scholastic classes accounted for their tolerance of conscription and of
      the tyranny of clanking soldiery in the streets, the cafés, and the hotels
      on the ground of disciplinary usefulness rather than military necessity.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then there was the human charm of some German homes to soothe away
      suspicion&mdash;the scholar&rsquo;s quiet house (beyond the clattering
      parade-ground at Potsdam) where we clinked glasses and drank &ldquo;to all good
      friends in England,&rdquo; and the sweet simplicity of the little town in
      Westphalia, with its green fields and its sweetly-flowing river, where the
      nightingale sang all night long, and where, in the midst of musical
      societies, Goethe Societies and Shakespeare Societies, it was so difficult
      to think of Germany as a nation dreaming only of world-power and dominion.
      Even yet it strikes a chill to the heart to recall those German homes as
      scenes of prolonged duplicity, I prefer not to do so. But all the same I
      see now that the wings of war were already approaching them, and that the
      German people heard their far-off murmur long before ourselves&mdash;heard
      it and told us nothing, perhaps much less and worse than nothing.

    <h2>
      THE FALLING OF THE THUNDERBOLT
    </h2>
    <p>
      Into such an unpromising atmosphere of national hostility the war came
      down on us, in July 1914, like a thunderbolt. In spite of grave warnings
      few or none in this country were at that moment giving a thought to it. On
      the contrary, we were thinking of all manner of immeasurably smaller
      things, for Great Britain, although governing more than one-fifth of the
      habitable globe, has an extraordinary capacity for becoming absorbed in
      the affairs of its two little islands. It was so in the autumn of 1914,
      when we thought Home Rule and Land Reform covered all our horizon,
      although a thunder-cloud that was to silence these big little guns had
      already gathered in the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps it was not altogether our fault if secret diplomacy had too long
      concealed from us the storm that was so soon to break. That kind of
      surprise must never come to us again. Many and obvious may be the dangers
      of allowing the public to participate in delicate and difficult
      negotiations between nations, but if democracy has any rights surely the
      chief of them is to know step by step by what means its representatives
      are controlling its destiny. We did not hear what was happening in the
      Cabinets of Europe, under that miserable disguise of the Archduke&rsquo;s
      assassination, until the closing days of July. Consequently, we reeled
      under the danger that threatened us, and were not at first capable of
      comprehending the cause and the measure of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is this wretched conspiracy in Serbia to us, and why in God&rsquo;s name
      should we have to fight about it?&rdquo; we thought. Or perhaps, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve always
      been told that treaties between nations are safeguards of peace, but here,
      heaven help us, they are dragging us into war.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So general was this sentiment of revolt during the last tragic days that
      it is commonly understood to have extended to the Cabinet. Six members are
      said to have opposed war. One of them, a philosopher and historian of high
      distinction, could not see his way with his colleagues, and retired from
      their company. Another, who came from the working-classes, is understood
      to have resigned from thought of the sufferings which any war, however
      justifiable, must inevitably inflict upon the poor. A third, a lawyer in a
      position of the utmost authority, is believed to have had grave misgivings
      about our legal right to call Germany to account. And I have heard that a
      fourth, who had been prominent as a pacifist in the days of an earlier
      conflict, had written a letter to a colleague as late as the evening of
      August 1, saying that a war declared merely on grounds of problematical
      self-interest would create such an outcry in Great Britain as had never
      been heard here before&mdash;leaving us a derided and, therefore,
      easily-vanquished people.

    <h2>
      THE PART CHANCE PLAYED
    </h2>
    <p>
      But chance plays the largest part in the drama of life, and accident often
      confounds the plans of men. Not feeling entirely sure of his letter the
      pacifist Minister put it in his pocket when he dressed that night to go
      out to dinner. And when he sat down at table he found himself seated next
      to the able, earnest, and passionately patriotic Minister for Belgium.
      Perhaps he was urging some objections to British intervention, when his
      neighbour said: &ldquo;But what about Belgium? You have promised to protect her,
      and if you don&rsquo;t do so she will be destroyed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That raised visions of the work of the little nations; memories of their
      immense contributions to human progress from the days of Israel downwards;
      thoughts of the vast loss to liberty, to morality, to religion, and to all
      the other fruits of the unfettered soul that would come to the world from
      the over-riding of the weak peoples by the strong. The result was swift
      and sure&mdash;the letter in the Minister&rsquo;s pocket never reached the
      important person to whom it was addressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only God knows whether this period, however short, of indecision among our
      people, and particularly among our responsible statesmen, with the
      consequent delay in dispatching a determined warning to Germany (&ldquo;Hands
      off Belgium,&rdquo;) contributed to the making of the war. But it is at least an
      evidence of our desire for peace, and a sufficient assurance that if
      unseen powers were working on our side also, they were the powers of good.
      Yet so strangely do the invisible forces confound the plans of men that
      the crowning proof of this came two days later&mdash;on August 8, in the
      Commons&mdash;when our Foreign Minister defined the British position, and
      practically declared for war.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not idle rumour that the Government went down to the House that day
      expecting to be resisted. The sequel was a startling surprise. Sir Edward
      Grey&rsquo;s speech was far from a great oration. It gave the effect of being
      unprepared as to form, so loosely did the vehicle hang together, the
      sentences sometimes coming with strange inexactitude for the tongue of one
      whose written word in dispatches has a clarity and precision that have
      never been excelled. But it had the supreme qualities of manifest
      sincerity and transparent honesty, and it derived its overwhelming effect
      from one transcendent characteristic of which the speaker himself may have
      been quite unconscious. It spoke to the British Empire as to a British
      gentleman. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t stand by and do nothing while the friend by your
      side is being beaten to his knees. You can&rsquo;t let a mischievous and
      unprincipled buccaneer tread into the dust the neighbour whom he has
      joined with you in swearing to protect?&rdquo; There was no resisting that Our
      own interest might leave us cold; we might even be sceptical of our
      danger. But we were put on our honour, and every man in the House with the
      instincts of a gentleman was swept away by that appeal as by a flood.

    </div>
    <h2>
      &ldquo;WHY ISN&rsquo;T THE HOUSE CHEERING?&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p>
      Then came our Prime Minister&rsquo;s passionate, fiery, yet dignified and even
      exalted denunciation of the proposal of Germany that we should trade with
      her in our neutrality by committing treachery to France and Belgium&mdash;(&ldquo;To
      accept your infamous offer would be to cover the glorious name of England
      with undying shame&rdquo;); then the announcement of the ultimatum sent by Great
      Britain to Germany demanding an assurance that the neutrality of Belgium
      should be respected; and finally that speech of John Redmond&rsquo;s, which,
      spoken on the very top of the crisis that had threatened to bring a
      fratricidal war into Ireland, has been, perhaps, the most thrilling and
      dramatic utterance yet produced by the war. &ldquo;I tell the Government they
      may take every British soldier out of Ireland to meet the enemy of the
      Empire. Ireland&rsquo;s sons will take care of Ireland. The Catholics of the
      South will stand shoulder to shoulder with their Protestant
      fellow-countrymen of the North to fight the common foe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was another appeal to the gentlemen in the British nation, and in one
      moment it swept the bitter waters of the Home Rule crisis out of all sight
      and memory. I have heard a Cabinet Minister say that, as he listened to
      Redmond&rsquo;s speech, he was surprised at the silence with which it was
      received. &ldquo;Why isn&rsquo;t the House cheering?&rdquo; he had asked himself. But all at
      once he had felt his eyes swimming and his throat tightening, and then he
      had understood.

    <h2>
      THE NIGHT OF OUR ULTIMATUM
    </h2>
    <p>
      Our nation knew everything now, and had made her choice, yet the twelve
      hours&rsquo; interval between noon and midnight of August 4 were perhaps the
      gravest moments in her modern history. I am tempted, not without some
      misgivings, but with the confidence of a good intention, to trespass so
      far on personal information as to lift the curtain on a private scene in
      the tremendous tragic drama.
    </p>
    <p>
      The place is a room in the Prime Minister&rsquo;s house in Downing Street. The
      Prime Minister himself and three of the principal members of his Cabinet
      are waiting there for the reply to the ultimatum which they sent to
      Germany at noon. The time for the reply expires at midnight. It is
      approaching eleven o&rsquo;clock. In spite of her &ldquo;infamous proposal,&rdquo; the
      Ministers cannot even yet allow themselves to believe that Germany will
      break her pledged word.
    </p>
    <p>
      She would be so palpably in the wrong. It is late and she has not yet
      replied, but she will do so&mdash;she must. There is more than an hour
      left, and even at the last moment the telephone bell may ring and then the
      reply of Germany, as handed to the British Ambassador in Berlin, will have
      reached London.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a calm autumn evening, and the windows are open to St. James&rsquo;s Park,
      which lies dark and silent as far as to Buckingham Palace in the distance.
      The streets of London round about the official residence are busy enough
      and quivering with excitement. We British people do not go in solid masses
      surging and singing down our Corso, or light candles along the line of our
      boulevards. But nevertheless all hearts are beating high&mdash;in our
      theatres, our railway stations, our railway trains, our shops, and our
      houses. Everybody is thinking, &ldquo;By twelve o&rsquo;clock to-night Germany has got
      to say whether or not she is a perjurer and a thief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, in the silent room overlooking the park time passes slowly. In
      spite of the righteousness of our cause, it is an awful thing to plunge a
      great empire into war. The miseries and horrors of warfare rise before the
      eyes of the Ministers, and the sense of personal responsibility becomes
      almost insupportable. Could anything be more awful than to have to ask
      oneself some day in the future, awakening in the middle of the night
      perhaps, after rivers of blood have been shed, &ldquo;Did I do right after all?&rdquo;
       The reply to the ultimatum has not even yet arrived, and the absence of a
      reply is equivalent to a declaration of war.

      THE THUNDERSTROKE OF FATE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Suddenly one of the little company remembers something which everybody has
      hitherto forgotten&mdash;the difference of an hour between the time in
      London and the time in Berlin. Midnight by mid-European time would be
      eleven o&rsquo;clock in London. Germany would naturally understand the demand
      for a reply by midnight to mean midnight in the country of dispatch.
      Therefore at eleven o&rsquo;clock by London time the period for the reply will
      expire. It is now approaching eleven.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the clock ticks out the remaining minutes the tension becomes terrible.
      Talk slackens. There are long pauses. The whole burden of the frightful
      issues involved for Great Britain, France, Belgium, Russia, Germany&mdash;for
      Europe, for the world, for civilization, for religion itself, seems to be
      gathered up in these last few moments. If war comes now it will be the
      most frightful tragedy the world has ever witnessed. Twenty millions of
      dead perhaps, and civil life crippled for a hundred years. Which is it to
      be, peace or war? Terrible to think that as they sit there the electric
      wires may be flashing the awful tidings, like a flying angel of life or
      death, through the dark air all over Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The four men are waiting for the bell of the telephone to ring. It does
      not ring, and the fingers of the clock are moving. The world seems to be
      on tiptoe, listening for a thunderstroke of Fate. The Ministers at length
      sit silent, rigid, almost petrified, looking fixedly at floor or ceiling.
      Then through the awful stillness of the room and the park outside comes
      the deep boom of &ldquo;Big Ben.&rdquo; Boom, boom, boom! No one moves until the last
      of the eleven strokes has gone reverberating through the night. Then comes
      a voice, heavy with emotion, yet firm with resolve, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s war.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the clock struck again (at midnight) Great Britain had been at war
      for an hour without knowing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I have done wrong in lifting the curtain on this private scene, I ask
      forgiveness for the sake of the purpose I put it to&mdash;that of showing
      that it was not in haste, not in anger, but with an awful sense of
      responsibility to Great Britain and to humanity that our responsible
      Ministers drew the sword of our country.

    <h2>
      THE MORNING AFTER
    </h2>
    <p>
      If Mr. Maeterlinck&rsquo;s theory is sound, that this war is the visible
      reflection of a vast, invisible conflict, what a gigantic battle of the
      unseen forces of good and evil must have been raging throughout the
      universe when Europe rose on the morning of August 5, 1914! Think what had
      happened. While the light was dawning, the sun was rising, and the birds
      were singing over Europe, the greater nations were preparing to turn a
      thousand square miles of it into a gigantic slaughter-house. After forty
      years of unbroken peace, in which civilization, as represented by law,
      science, surgery, medicine, art, music, literature, and above all
      religion, in their ancient and central home, had been striving to lift up
      man to the place he is entitled to in the scheme of creation, war had
      suddenly stepped in to drag him back to the condition of the barbarian.
      From this day onward he was to live in holes in the ground, to be
      necessarily unclean, inevitably verminous, and liable to loathsome
      diseases. Although hitherto law-abiding, and perhaps even pious, with an
      ever-developing sense of the value and sanctity of human life, he was
      henceforward to take joy in the destruction of thousands of his
      fellow-creatures by devilish machines of death, and not to shrink from an
      opportunity of thrusting his bayonet down the throat of his enemy. He was
      to set fire to churches, to throw images of Christ into the road, and,
      showing no mercy to old men and women and children, to destroy all and
      spare none. And why? Ostensibly because one quite commonplace Austrian
      gentleman had been foully murdered, but really because a vain and
      ambitious and rapidly increasing nation, living on an arid and
      insufficient soil, had come to consider themselves the master-spirits of
      humanity, and therefore entitled to possess the earth, or at least give
      law to all other nations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are doing wrong, but it is necessary to do wrong, and we shall make
      amends as soon as our military necessities have been served.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      &ldquo;YOUR KING AND COUNTRY NEED YOU&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p>
      What a mockery! What a waste! What a hideous reversion! What a confession
      of blank failure on the part of civilization, including morality and
      religion! But, happily, the invisible powers of evil had not got it all
      their own way, even on that morning of August 5. Out of the very shadow of
      battle great things were already being born among the children of men, and
      chief among them were the spirits of sacrifice and brotherhood. Even the
      cruel loss of nearly all that makes human life worth living&mdash;cleanliness
      and purity and exemption from foul disease&mdash;could be borne for the
      defence of truth and freedom. And then it was worth a world of suffering
      to realize the first-fruits of that golden age of brotherhood among all
      the nations of the earth (except those of our enemy) which has been the
      peace-dream of humanity for countless centuries.
    </p>
    <p>
      We in Great Britain have no reason to be ashamed of how our country
      answered the call. A few years before the outbreak of war I talked about
      conscription with a British admiral in the cabin of his flagship. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
      not the slightest necessity for it in this country,&rdquo; said the admiral. The
      moment war was declared the whole nation would rise to it. A great thrill
      would pass over our people from end to end of the land, and we should have
      millions flocking to the colours.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old sailor proved to be a true prophet. None of us can ever forget the
      spontaneous response in August 1914 to the cry, &ldquo;Your King and country
      need you.&rdquo; To such as, like myself, are on the shadowed side of the hill
      of life, and therefore too old for service, it was a profoundly moving
      thing to see how swiftly our immense voluntary army sprang (as by a
      miracle) out of the earth, to look at the long lines of young soldiers
      passing with their regular step through the streets of London, to think of
      the situations given up, of the young wives and little children living at
      home on shortened means, and of the risk taken of life being lost just
      when it is most precious and most sweet.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was the motive power that impelled the young manhood of Great Britain
      to this tremendous sacrifice? The thought of our country&rsquo;s danger? The
      danger to France? The danger to Belgium? The fact that a man named
      Palmerston had pledged his solemn word for them long years before they
      were born, or even the mothers who bore them were born, that they would go
      to their deaths rather than allow a great crime to be committed or
      England&rsquo;s oath be broken? I don&rsquo;t know. I do not believe anybody knows.
      But I am not ashamed of my tears when I remember it all, and sure I am
      that in those first critical days of the war the invisible powers of
      justice must have been fighting on our side.

    <h2>
      THE PART PLAYED BY THE BRITISH NAVY
    </h2>
    <p>
      Perhaps the first of the flashes as of lightning by which we have seen the
      drama of the past 365 days is that which shows us the part played by the
      British Navy. What a part it has been! Do we even yet recognize its
      importance? Have our faithful and loyal Allies a full sense of its
      tremendous effect on the fortunes of the campaign? On Sunday, August 2,
      two days before the dispatch of Great Britain&rsquo;s ultimatum to Germany, we
      saw thousands of our naval reserve flying off by special boats and trains
      to their ships on our east and south coasts. On Monday, August 8, the
      British Navy had taken possession of the North Sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a legitimate act of peace, yet never in this world was there a more
      complete, if bloodless, victory. The great German North Sea fleet, which
      (according to a calculation) had been constructed at a cost of
      £300,000,000 sterling, to keep open the seas of the world to German trade;
      the fleet which had, in our British view, been built with the sole purpose
      of menacing British shores, was shut up in one day within the narrow
      limits of its own waters!
    </p>
    <p>
      In the light of what has happened since it is not too much to say that if
      the British Fleet had taken up its cue only forty-eight hours later the
      north coast of France would have been bombarded, every town on our east
      coast from Aberdeen to Dover would have been destroyed, and Lord Roberts&rsquo;s
      prophecy of German invasion would have been fulfilled. But, thank God, the
      watchdogs of the British Navy were there to prevent that swift surprise.
      They are there (or elsewhere) still, silently riding the grey waters in
      all seasons and all weathers, waiting and watching and biding their time,
      and meanwhile (in spite of the occasional marauding of submarines, the
      offal of fighting craft) keeping the oceans free to all ships except those
      of our enemies. And now, when we hear it said, as we sometimes do, that
      Great Britain holds only thirty-five miles of land on the battle-front in
      Flanders, let us lift our heads and answer, &ldquo;Yes, but she holds
      thirty-five thousand miles of sea.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      THE PART PLAYED BY BELGIUM
    </h2>
    <p>
      One of the earliest, and perhaps one of the most inspiring, of the flashes
      as of lightning whereby we saw the drama of the war was that which
      revealed the part played by Belgium. Has history any record of greater
      heroism and greater suffering? Such courage for the right! Such strength
      of soul against overwhelming odds and the criminal suddenness of surprise!
      Although the world has been told by Germany&rsquo;s spokesmen, including Herr
      Ballin, Prince von Bülow, and even Professor Harnack (all &ldquo;honourable
      men,&rdquo; and the last of them a churchman), that down to a few days before
      the outbreak of hostilities &ldquo;not one human being&rdquo; among them had &ldquo;dreamt
      of war,&rdquo; it is the fact that within a few hours of the dispatch of
      Germany&rsquo;s ultimatum, to Belgium, before the ink of it could yet be dry and
      while the period of England&rsquo;s ultimatum in defence of Belgian integrity
      was still unexpired, the German legions were attacking Liège.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a cowardly and contemptible assault, but what a resistance it met
      with! A little peace-loving, industrial nation, infinitely small and
      almost utterly untrained, compared with the giant in arms assailing it,
      having no injury to avenge, no commerce to capture, no territory to annex,
      desiring only to be left alone in the exercise of its independence, stood
      up for six days against the invading horde, and hurled it back.
    </p>
    <p>
      But war is a crude and clumsy instrument for the defence of the right, and
      after a flash of Belgium&rsquo;s unexampled bravery we were compelled to witness
      many flashes of her terrible sufferings. Liège fell before overwhelming
      numbers, then Namur, Ter-monde, Brussels, Louvain, and, last of all,
      Antwerp. What a spectacle of horror! The harvests of Belgium trodden into
      the earth, her beautiful cities and ancient villages given up to the
      flames, her historic monuments, that had been associated with the learning
      and piety of centuries, razed to the ground; and, above everything in its
      pathos and pain, the multitudes of her people, old men, old women, young
      girls, and little children in wooden shoes, after the unnameable
      atrocities of a brutalized, infuriated, and licentious soldiery, flying
      before their faces as before a plague!

    <h2>
      WHAT KING ALBERT DID FOR KINGSHIP
    </h2>
    <p>
      But there were flashes of almost divine light in the black darkness of
      Belgium&rsquo;s tragedy, and perhaps the brightest of them surrounded the person
      of her King. What King Albert did in those dark days of August 1914, to
      keep the soul of his nation alive in the midst of the immense sorrow of
      her utter overthrow his nation alone can fully know. But we who are not
      Belgians were thrilled again and again by the inspired tones of a great
      Spirit speaking to his subjects with that authority, dignity, and courage
      which alone among free nations are sufficient to unite the people to the
      Throne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A country which defends its liberties in the face of tyranny commands the
      respect of all. Such a country does not perish.&rdquo; What King Albert did for
      Belgium in the stand he made against German aggression is partly known
      already, and will leave its record in history, but what he did at the same
      time for kingship throughout the world, as well as in his country, can
      only be realized by the few who are aware that almost at the moment of the
      outbreak of war the Belgian Courts (much to the unmerited humiliation of
      Belgium) were on the eve of such disclosures in relation to the life and
      death of the King&rsquo;s predecessor as would certainly have shaken the credit
      of monarchy for centuries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nobody who ever met the late King Leopold could have had any doubt that he
      was a great man, if greatness can be separated from goodness and measured
      solely by energy of intellect and character. I see him now as I saw him in
      a garden of a house on the Riviera, the huge, unwieldy creature, with the
      eyes of an eagle, the voice of a bull and the flat tread of an elephant,
      and I recall the thought with which I came away: &ldquo;Thank God that man is
      only the King of a little country! If he had been the sovereign of a great
      State he would have become the scourge of the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After King Leopold&rsquo;s death, accident brought me knowledge of astounding
      facts of his last days which were shortly to be exposed in Court&mdash;of
      the measure of his unnatural hatred of his children; of his schemes to
      deprive them of their rightful inheritance; of his relations with certain
      of his favourites and his death-bed marriage to one of them; of the
      circumstances attending the surgical operation which immediately preceded
      the extinction of his life; of the burning of endless documents of
      doubtful credit during the night before the knife was used; of the
      intrigues of women of questionable character over the dying man&rsquo;s body to
      share the ill-got gold he had earned in the Congo, and finally of his end,
      not in his palace, but in a little hidden chalet, alone save for one
      scheming woman and one calculating priest. What a story it was, whether
      true or false, or (as is most probable) partly true and partly false, of
      shame, greed, lust, and life-long duplicity! And all this dark tale was
      (one way or other) to be told in the cold light of open Court, to the
      general discredit of monarchy, by showing the world how contemptible may
      be some of the creatures who control the destinies of mankind.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the war and King Albert&rsquo;s part in it saved Belgium from that unmerited
      obloquy. The modest, retiring, studious, almost shy but heroic young
      sovereign who, with his valiant little band, is fighting by the side of
      our own king&rsquo;s soldiers, and the soldiers of the Republic of France, has
      sustained the highest traditions of kingship. He may have lost his country
      at the hands of a great Power, drunk with pride, but he has won
      Immortality. He may have no more land left to him than his tent is pitched
      upon, but his spiritual empire is as wide as the world. He may be a king
      without a kingdom, but he still reigns over a kingdom of souls.

    <h2>
      &ldquo;WHY SHOULDN&rsquo;T THEY, SINCE THEY WERE ENGLISHMEN?&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p>
      The next flash as of lightning that revealed to us the progress of the
      drama of the past 365 days came at the end of the first month of the war
      with the terrible story of Mons. That touched us yet more closely than the
      tragedy of Belgium, for it seemed at first to be our own tragedy. Between
      the departure of an army and the first news of victory or defeat there is
      always a time of exhausting suspense. At what moment our first
      Expeditionary Force had left England no one quite knew, but after we
      learned that it had landed in France we waited with anxious hearts and
      listened with strained ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      We heard the tramp of the gigantic German army, pouring through the
      streets of Brussels, fully equipped down to its kitchens, its smoking
      coffee-wagons, its corps of gravediggers, and, of course, its cuirassiers
      in burnished helmets that were shining in the autumn sun. The huge,
      interminable, apparently irresistible multitude! Regiment after regiment,
      battalion after battalion, going on and on for hours, and even days&mdash;the
      mighty legions of the nation that a few days before had &ldquo;never so much as
      dreamt&rdquo; of war!
    </p>
    <p>
      At last we had news of our men. Against overwhelming odds they had fought
      like heroes&mdash;why shouldn&rsquo;t they, since they were Englishmen?&mdash;but
      had been compelled to fall back at length, and were now retreating
      rapidly, some reports said flying in confusion, broken and done. What? Was
      it possible? Our army thrown back in disorder? Our first army, too, the
      flower of the fighting men of the world? It was too monstrous, too awful!
    </p>
    <p>
      The news was cruelly, and even wickedly, exaggerated, but nevertheless it
      did us good. He knows the British character very imperfectly who does not
      see that the qualities in which it is unsurpassed among the races of
      mankind are those with which it meets adversity and confronts the darkest
      night. Within a few days of the report that our soldiers were falling back
      from Mons, the old cry &ldquo;Your King and country need you&rdquo; went through the
      land with a new thrill, and hundreds of thousands of free men leapt to the
      relief of the flag.
    </p>
    <p>
      There has been nothing like it in the history of any nation. And it is
      hard to say which is the more moving manifestation of that moment in the
      great drama of the war&mdash;the spontaneous response of the poor who
      sprang forward to defend their country, though they had no more material
      property in it than the right to as much of its soil as would make their
      graves, or the splendid reply of the rich whose lands were an agelong
      possession, and often the foundation of their titles and honours.

    <h2>
      &ldquo;BUT LIBERTY MUST GO ON, AND... ENGLAND.&rdquo;
     </h2>
    <p>
      What startling surprises! We of the lower, the middle, or the upper-middle
      classes had come to believe that too many of the young men of our nobility
      had grown effeminate in idleness and selfish pleasure indulged in on the
      borderland of a kind of aristocratic Bohemia, but, behold! they were
      fighting and dying with the bravest. We had thought too many of their
      young women (as thoughtless and capricious creatures of fashion) had
      sacrificed the finest bloom of modest and courageous womanhood in luxury
      and self-indulgence; but, lo! they were hurrying to the battlefields as
      nurses, and there facing without flinching the scenes of blood and horror,
      of foul sights and stenches, which make the bravest man&rsquo;s heart turn sick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the scenes at home in those last days of August and early days of
      September were yet more affecting. The first of our casualty lists had
      been published, and they were terrible. They hit the old people hardest,
      the old fathers and old mothers who had given all, and had nothing left&mdash;not
      even a little child to live for. At the railway stations, when fresh
      troops were leaving for the front, you saw sights which searched the heart
      so much that you felt ashamed to look, feeling they opened sanctuaries in
      which God&rsquo;s eye alone should see.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Lady So-and-So seeing her youngest son off to Flanders. She has lost
      two of her sons in the war already, and Archie is the last of them. The
      dear old darling! It is pitiful to see her in her deep black, struggling
      to keep up before the boy. But when the train has left the platform and
      she can no longer wave her handkerchief she breaks down utterly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
      seen the last of him,&rdquo; she says; &ldquo;something tells me I&rsquo;ve seen the last of
      him. And now I&rsquo;ve given everything I have to the country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ah! that&rsquo;s what you have all got to do, or be prepared to do, you brave
      mothers of England, if you have to defeat a desperate enemy, who stoops to
      any method, any crime.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then old Lord Such-a-One at Victoria to meet the body of his only son
      being brought back from the hospital at Boulogne. How proud he had been of
      his boy! He could remember the day he captained for Eton at Lord&rsquo;s, or
      perhaps rowed stroke&mdash;and won&mdash;for Cambridge. And now on the
      field of Flanders.... He had seen it coming, though. He had thought of it
      when the war broke out. &ldquo;Ours is an old family,&rdquo; he had told himself,
      &ldquo;four hundred years old, and my son is the last of us. If I let him go to
      the war my line may end, my family may stop... but then liberty must go
      on, civilization must go on, and... England!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yes, it must be night before the British star will shine.

    <h2>
      THE PART PLAYED BY FRANCE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Perhaps the next great flash as of lightning whereby we saw the drama of
      the past 365 days was that which revealed at its sublimest moment the part
      played by France. In those evil days of July 1914, when German diplomacy
      was carrying on the indecent pretence of quarrelling with France about
      Austria&rsquo;s right to punish Serbia for the assassination of the Archduke
      Ferdinand, there were Frenchmen still living who had vivid memories of
      three bloody campaigns. Some could remember the Crimean War. More could
      recall the Italian War of 1859, which brought the delirious news of the
      victory of Magenta, and closed with Solferino, and the triumphant march
      home through the Place de la Bastille, and down the Rue de la Paix. And
      vast numbers were still alive who could remember 1870, when the Emperor
      was defeated at Worth and conquered at Sedan; when Paris was surrounded by
      a Prussian army, when the booming of cannon could be heard on the
      boulevards; when tenderly nurtured women, who had never thought to beg
      their bread, had been forced by the hunger of their children to stand in
      long queues at the doors of the bakers&rsquo; shops; when the city was at length
      starved into submission, and the proud French people, with their
      immemorial heritage of fame, were compelled to permit the glittering
      Prussian helmets to go shining down their streets.
    </p>
    <p>
      A new generation had been born to France since even the last of these
      events, but was it with a light heart that she took up the gage which
      Germany so haughtily threw down? Indeed, no! Never had France, the bright,
      the brilliant, the cheerful-hearted, shown the world a graver face.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few students across the Seine might shout &ldquo;A Berlin! A Berlin!&rdquo; just as
      our boys in khaki chalked up the same address on their gun carriages.
      Idlers in blouses along the quays might scream the &ldquo;Marseillaise.&rdquo; Gangs
      of ruffians in back streets might break the windows of the shops of German
      tradespeople. Some bitter old campaigners might talk about revenge. But
      when the drums beat for the French regiments to start away for Alsace and
      the Belgian frontier, the heart of France was calm and steadfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is a fight for the right, for France, and for the freedom of our
      souls!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      THE SOUL OF FRANCE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Then when the men had gone there came that anxious silence in which every
      ear was strained to catch the first cry from the army. Would it be victory
      or defeat? In the strength of her new-born spirit France was ready for
      either fate. The streets of Paris were darkened; the theatres were shut
      up; the cafés were ordered to close at nine o&rsquo;clock; the sale of absinthe
      was prohibited that Frenchmen might have every faculty alert to meet their
      destiny; and the principal hotels were transformed into hospitals for the
      wounded that would surely come.
    </p>
    <p>
      They came. We were allowed to see their coming, and in those early days of
      the war, before the Red Cross companies had got properly to work, the
      return of the first of the fallen among the French soldiery made a
      terrible spectacle. At suburban stations, generally in the middle of the
      night, long lines of third-class railway carriages, as well as
      rectangular, box-shaped cattle wagons, such as in conscript countries are
      used for purposes of mobilization, would draw up out of the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instantly hundreds of pale, wasted, generally bearded, and often wounded
      faces would appear at the windows, crying out for coffee or chocolate.
      Then the cattle wagons would be unbolted, and the great doors thrown back,
      disclosing six or eight men in each, lying outstretched on straw, with
      their limbs swathed in blood-stained bandages, and their eyes glazed with
      pain. They were the brave fellows who, a few weeks before, had gone to
      Flanders in the pride and prime of their strength. In some cases they had
      lain like that for two whole days on their long way back from the fighting
      line, with no one to give them meat or drink, with nothing to see in the
      darkness of their moving tomb and nothing to hear, except the grinding of
      the iron wheels beneath them, and the cries of the comrades by their side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mon Dieu! Que de souffrances! Qui l&rsquo;aurait cru possible? O mon Dieu, aie
      pitié de moi.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      THE MOTHERHOOD OF FRANCE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Still the soul of France did not fail her. It heard the second approach of
      that monstrous Prussian horde, which, like a broad, irresistible tide,
      sweeping across one half of Europe, came down, down, down from Mons until
      the thunder of its guns could again be heard on the boulevards. And then
      came the great miracle! Just as the sea itself can rise no higher when it
      has reached the top of the flood, so the mighty army of Germany had to
      stop its advance thirty kilomètres north of Paris, and when it stirred
      again it had to go back. And back and back it went before the armies of
      France, Britain, and Belgium, until it reached a point at which it could
      dig itself into the earth and hide in a long serpentine trench stretching
      from the Alps to the sea. Only then did the spirit of France draw breath
      for a moment, and the next flash as of lightning showed her offering
      thanks and making supplications before the white statue of Jeanne d&rsquo;Arc in
      the apse of the great cathedral of Notre Dame, sacred to innumerable
      memories. On the Feast of St Michael 10,000 of the women of Paris were
      kneeling under the dark vault, and on the broad space in front of the
      majestic façade, to call on the Maid of Orleans to % intercede with the
      Virgin for victory. It was a great and grandiose scene, recalling the days
      when faith was strong and purer. Old and young, rich and poor, every woman
      with some soul that was dear to her in that inferno at the front&mdash;the
      Motherhood of France was there to pray to the Mother of all living to ask
      God for the triumph of the right.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jesus, hear our cry for our country! Justice for France, O God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And in the spirit of that prayer the soul of France still lives.

    <h2>
      FIVE MONTHS AFTER
    </h2>
    <p>
      The next of the flashes as of lightning that revealed the drama of the
      past 365 days came to us at Christmas. The war had then been going on five
      months, showing us many strange and terrible sights, but nothing stranger
      and more terrible than the changed aspect of warfare itself. A battlefield
      had ceased to be a scene of pomp and of personal prowess, with the
      charging of galloping cavalry, the clash of glittering arms, and the
      advancing and retiring of vast numbers of soldiery. It was now a broad and
      desolate waste, in which no human figure was anywhere visible as far as
      the eye could reach&mdash;a monstrous scar on the face of the globe, such
      as we see in volcanic countries, only differing in the evidence of design
      that came of long, parallel lines of turned-up soil, which were the
      trenches wherein hundreds of thousands of men lived under the surface of
      the ground. Over this barren waste there was almost perpetual smoke, and
      through the smoke a deafening cannonading, which came of the hurling
      through the air of scythes of steel, called shells. Sometimes the shells
      were burying themselves unbroken in the empty earth, but too often they
      were scouring the trenches, where they were bursting into jagged parts and
      sending up showers of horrible fragments which had once been the limbs of
      living men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was warfare by machinery as the world caught its first, full,
      horrified sight of it between the beginning of August and the end of
      December 1914. But even out of that maelstrom of horror there had been
      glimpses of great things&mdash;great heroisms, great victories, and great
      proofs of the power to endure. A rigid censorship, rightly designed to
      keep back from the enemy the information that would endanger the lives of
      our soldiers, was also keeping us in ignorance of many glorious incidents
      of the war such as would have thrilled us up to our throbbing throat. But
      some of them could not possibly be concealed, so we heard of the gallant
      stand of the dauntless sons of our daughter Canada, and we saw our great
      old warrior, Lord Roberts, going out to the front in his eighty-third year
      to visit his beloved Indian troops, dying as was most fit on the
      battlefield, within sound of the guns in the war he had foretold, and then
      being brought home, borne through the crowded streets of London and buried
      under the dome of St. Paul&rsquo;s, amid the homage of his Bang and people.

    <h2>
      THE COMING OF WINTER
    </h2>
    <p>
      Then, as the year deepened towards winter, the rains came, torrential
      rains such as we thought we had never known the like of before. We heard
      that the trenches were flooded, and that our soldiers were eating,
      sleeping, and fighting ankle-deep (sometimes knee-deep) in water. At
      night, on going to our white beds at home, we had remorseful visions of
      those slimy red ruts in Flanders where our boys were lying out in the
      drenching rain under the heavy darkness of the sky. It was hard to believe
      that human strength could sustain itself against such cruel conditions,
      and indeed it often failed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards Christmas tens of thousands of our men had to be brought home to
      our hospitals, many of them wounded, but not a few suffering from maladies
      which made them unfit for military service. The accident of being asked to
      distribute presents enabled me to see and talk with hundreds of them. It
      was a sweet and exhilarating yet rather nerve-racking experience. These
      young fellows, who had looked on death in its most horrible aspects,
      having had it for their duty to kill as many Germans as possible, and then
      to eat and sleep as if nothing had occurred&mdash;had they been degraded,
      brutalized, lowered in the scale of human creatures by their awful ordeal?
    </p>
    <p>
      The sequel surprised me. The veil of mist with which a London winter
      enshrouds the beginnings of night and day had only just risen when on
      Christmas morning I reached the wounded soldiers&rsquo; ward in the first of the
      hospitals I visited. The sweet place was decked out with holly and
      mistletoe. Forty or fifty men were lying there in their beds, some
      bandaged about the head, a few about the face, more about the body, arms,
      and legs. None of them seemed to be in serious pain, and nearly all were
      cheerful, even bright, boyish, and almost childlike. What stories they had
      to tell of the inferno they had come from! It was hell, infernal hell.
      They would go back, of course, when they were better, and had to do so,
      but if anybody said he <i>wanted</i> to go back he was telling a damn&rsquo;d
      lie.
    </p>
    <p>
      One boy, scarcely out of his teens, with soft, womanly eyes, light hair,
      and a face that made me sure he must be the living image of his mother,
      had had a narrow escape. After being wounded he had been taken prisoner to
      a farmhouse. Nobody there had done anything for him, and at length, after
      many hours, watching his opportunity, he had crept into the darkness and
      got back to the British trenches by crawling for nearly a quarter of a
      mile on hands and knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another young soldier, an Irishman, told me a brave story, such as might
      have been allowed, I thought, to scratch and scrape its way through the
      thorn hedge of the strictest censorship. It was a story of the great days
      before the armies had dug themselves into the earth like rabbits. Perhaps
      I had heard something about it? I had. Eight hundred of his cavalry
      regiment had ridden full gallop into a solid block of the enemy, making a
      way through them as wide as Sackville Street. At length the Germans in
      front had dropped their rifles and held up their hands, whereupon our men
      had ceased to slay. But, being unable to rein in their frantic horses,
      they had been compelled to gallop on. Then, while their backs were turned,
      the treacherous Huns had picked up their rifles and fired on them from
      behind, killing many of our best men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what did you do then?&rdquo; I asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Turned back and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Took one man alive, sor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the rest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Left them there, sor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how many of you got back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Less than two hundred, sor.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHRISTMAS IN THE TRENCHES
    </h2>
    <p>
      Then Christmas in the trenches&mdash;we had glimpses of that, too. The
      people who governed nations from their Parliament Houses might have doubts
      about the peace-dream of the poets, the Utopia of universal brotherhood
      which gleams somewhere ahead in the far future of humanity, but the
      soldiers on the battlefields, even in the welter of blood and death had
      somehow heard the call of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The appeal of the Pope for a truce to hostilities during the days sacred
      to the Christian faith had fallen on deaf ears in the Cabinets of Europe.
      In that zone of mutual deception which is another name for war, neither of
      the belligerents could trust the other not to take an unfair advantage of
      any respite from slaying that might be called in the name of Christ, and,
      therefore, the armies must continue to fight. But the men in the trenches
      had found for them-selves a better way. When Christmas Eve came they began&mdash;German
      and British&mdash;to talk about Christmas Eves which they had spent at
      home. Visions arose of crowded streets, of shops decorated with holly and
      mistletoe, of churches with little candle-lit Nativities, of
      Christmas-trees at home laden with fairy lamps and presents, of children
      sitting up late to dance and laugh and then hanging up their stockings
      before going to bed to dream of Santa Claus, of church bells ringing for
      midnight mass, and, last of all, of the &ldquo;waits&rdquo; by the old cross in the
      market-place in the midst of the winter frost and snow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly in one of the trenches some of the soldiers began to sing. They
      sang a Christmas carol, &ldquo;While shepherds watched their flocks by night.&rdquo;
       The soldiers in the parallel trenches of the enemy heard it, knew what it
      was, and joined in with another Christmas carol, sung in their own
      language. In a little while both sides were singing, each in its turn,
      listening and replying, all along the two dark gullies that stretched
      across blood-stained Europe. Then Chinese lanterns were lit and stuck up
      on the head of the trenches, and salutations were shouted across the
      narrow ground between. &ldquo;Merry Christmas to you, Fritz, old man!&rdquo; &ldquo;Same to
      you, Tommy!&rdquo; And then next morning, Christmas morning, in the grey light
      of the late dawn, some daring soul, clambering over the trench head,
      marched boldly up to the line of the enemy with the salutation of the
      sacred day. In another moment everybody was up and out, shaking hands, and
      posing for photographs, friend and foe, German and British.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a while they became aware that the ground they were standing on was
      like an unroofed charnel-house, littered over with the bodies of their
      unburied dead. So they set themselves to cover up their comrades in the
      earth, never asking which was British and which German, but laying them
      all together in the everlasting brotherhood of death&mdash;that English
      boy whose mother was waiting for him in England, and this German lad whose
      young wife was weeping in his German home.
    </p>

    <h2>
      THE COMING OF SPRING
    </h2>
    <p>
      But perhaps, as Zola says, it is only the soft-hearted philosophers who
      are loud in their curses of war, and the truer wisdom was that of the
      stoical ancients, who could look with indifference on the massacre of
      millions. To keep manly, to remind ourselves that the generations come and
      go, that after all people die, and that more die one year than another&mdash;this
      should be the wise man&rsquo;s way of reconciling himself to the inhumanities of
      war. It is horrible doctrine, but certainly nature seems to speak with
      that voice, and hence the pang that came to us with the next great flash
      as of lightning, which showed us the battle-front at the beginning of the
      spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      The long lines in the West had hardly changed so much as a single point to
      north or south since October 1914. Yet what horrors of conflict the
      intervening months had witnessed, bloody in their progress, though barren
      in their results! The storms of the spring (which in much of Northern
      Europe is only another name for a second winter) had gone through it all.
      Our soldiers had suffered frightfully, and some of us at home, awakening
      in the middle of stormy nights, had thought we heard the booming of
      far-off guns under the thunder of the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three millions of men were dead by this time, and that belt of green
      country, which many of us had crossed with light hearts a score of times,
      was nothing now but a vast graveyard stretching from the foot of the Swiss
      mountains to the margin of the North Sea. Here a charred and blackened
      mass of stones, which had once been a group of houses; there a cottage by
      the roadside, once sweet and pretty under its mantle of wild roses, now
      hideous with a gaping hole torn in its walls, and its little bed visible
      behind curtains that used to be white. And yet Nature was going on the
      same as ever&mdash;hardly giving a hint that the Great Death had passed
      that way. Our boys at the front wrote home that the leaves were beginning
      to show on the trees, that the grass was growing again, and that in the
      lulls of the cannonading they could hear the birds singing.

    <h2>
      NATURE GOES HER OWN WAY
    </h2>
    <p>
      We found it heart-breaking. But it has been always so. I was in Naples
      during the whole period of the last great eruption of Vesuvius, and,
      looking through the gloom of the heavens, piled high with the whorls of
      fire and smoke that were covering the Vesuvian valleys and villages with a
      grey shroud, waist deep, of volcanic dust, I thought the face of Nature in
      that sweet spot could never be the same again; but when I went back to it
      a year later I could see no difference. I sailed south through the Straits
      of Messina a few weeks before the earthquake, and, returning north a few
      months later, I looked eagerly for the change which I imagined must have
      been made by the frightful upheaval of the earth that had killed hundreds
      of thousands, and shaken the soul of the entire human family, but I could
      see no change at all, even through the strongest field-glasses, until I
      came within sight of the waste and wreckage of the little works of men.
      Yes, Nature goes her own way, winter and summer, seedtime and harvest,
      healing her own wounds, but taking no thought of ours.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, cruel as Nature seemed to be at the beginning of the spring, it was
      not so cruel as man. With the better weather our enemies began to devise
      and put into operation new and more devilish methods of warfare. Perhaps
      this was a result of their fear, for there is no cruelty so cruel as the
      cruelty that comes of fear, and no inhumanity so inhuman. Having expressed
      themselves as shocked by our alleged use of dum-dum bullets, they were now
      ransacking their laboratory for gases that would burst the lungs of our
      soldiers, and for inflammable oils that would set them afire as if they
      were criminals tarred and feathered and tied to a stake. Their
      battleships, built to fight craft of their own kind, or at least
      fortresses capable of replying to their fire, were now sent out to bombard
      innocent watering-places lying breast open to the sea. Their air-craft,
      constructed for reconnaissances, were ordered to drop bombs out of the
      clouds on to sleeping cities in the darkness of the night. And their
      submarines, tolerated by international courts only as weapons of attack on
      warships, were authorized to sink harmless merchantmen, without any word
      of warning, or any effort to save life. Could scientific knowledge under
      the direction of moral insanity go one step farther? Flying in the highest
      sky, hiding behind the densest clouds, stealing across the heavens in the
      dark hours, dropping fireballs on to the silent earth, sneaking back in
      the dawn; and then sailing through the womb of the great deep, rising like
      a serpent to spit death at innocent ships, diving to avoid destruction and
      scudding away under cover of the empty sea&mdash;what a spectacle of
      divine power at the service of devilish passion! It was difficult to
      believe that our enemies had not gone mad. They were no longer fighting
      like men, but like demons.

      THE SOUL OF THE MAN WHO SANK THE <i>LUSITANIA</i>
    </h2>
    <p>
      The crowning horror of Germany&rsquo;s barbarities came with the sinking of the
      <i>Lusitania</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps nothing less shocking could have made us see how much less cruel
      Nature is at her worst than man in his madness may be. Three years before
      the <i>Titanic</i> had been sunk on a clear and quiet night, because a
      great iceberg formed in the frozen north had floated silently down to
      where, crossing the ship&rsquo;s course in mid-Atlantic, it struck her the
      slanting blow that sent her to the bottom. Thus a great, blind,
      irresistible force, operating without malice or design, had in that case
      destroyed more than a thousand human lives. But when the <i>Lusitania</i>
      was sunk in broad daylight, and nearly as many persons perished, it was
      because our brother man, in the bitterness of his heart and the cruelty of
      his fear, had been bent on committing wilful murder.
    </p>
    <p>
      What is the present state of the soul of the person who perpetrated that
      crime?
    </p>
    <p>
      Can he excuse himself on the ground that he was obeying orders, or does
      his conscience refuse to be chloroformed into silence by that hoary old
      subterfuge? When he first saw the great ship sailing up in the sunshine,
      its decks crowded with peaceful passengers, and he rose like a murderer
      out of his hiding-place in the bowels of the sea, what were the feelings
      with which he ordered the torpedo to be fired? When, having launched his
      bolt, he sank and then rose again, and heard the drowning cries of his
      victims struggling in the water, what were the emotions with which he ran
      away? And when he returned to tell his story of the work he had done, with
      what dignity of manhood did he hold up his head in the company of
      Christian men? God knows&mdash;only God and one of his creatures.

    <h2>
      THE GERMAN TOWER OF BABEL
    </h2>
    <p>
      For the credit of human nature we feel compelled, in sight of such
      enormities, to go back to Mr. Maeterlinck&rsquo;s theory that invisible powers
      of evil are using man for the execution of devilish designs. But if so,
      they have had no mercy on their creatures. We read that when, in fear of
      another flood, not trusting the promises of the Almighty, the children of
      Noah began to build a Tower of Babel, the Lord sent a confusion of tongues
      among them to bring their design to destruction. The excuses the Germans
      have offered for their barbarities suggest a confusion of intellect that
      can only lead to a like result. Has the world ever before listened to such
      whirlwind logic?
    </p>
    <p>
      When a German submarine has sunk a British merchantman and left her crew
      to perish we have been told that she was performing a legitimate act of
      war. But when a British merchantman has mounted a gun in order to defend
      herself, she has been said to violate the law of nations. When British
      battleships have blockaded German ports they have been trying to starve
      sixty-five millions of German people. But when German submarines have
      attempted to blockade British ports by drowning a thousand passengers of
      many nations on a British liner, they have been executing a just revenge.
      When a neutral nation in Europe has supplied foodstuffs and materials of
      war to Germany, she has been doing an act of simple humanity. But when the
      United States has supplied foodstuffs and materials of war to Great
      Britain she has been breaking the laws of her neutrality. When a brutal
      German officer has shot a British civilian in a railway train he has
      committed a justifiable homicide and becomes a proper person for
      promotion. But when a Belgian civilian has killed a German soldier who
      violated his daughter before his eyes he has been guilty of assassination
      and quite properly shot at sight. When Germany has refused to honour her
      name to a &ldquo;scrap of paper&rdquo; she has been a holy martyr obeying a law of
      necessity. But when England has honoured hers she has been a holy humbug,
      whose hypocrisy deserved to be exposed. Therefore God punish England!
      Above all, when God has crowned the arms of Germany with success on the
      battlefield, his most Christian Majesty, William the Pious, has always
      been with Him. Therefore God bless the Kaiser!
    </p>
    <p>
      Surely confusion of intellect can go no further, and the German Tower of
      Babel must soon fall.

    <h2>
      THE ALIEN PERIL
    </h2>
    <p>
      But out of this failure of logic on the part of &ldquo;deep-thinking Germany&rdquo; a
      danger came to us from nearer home than the battlefield. One of the most
      vivid flashes as of lightning whereby we have seen the drama of the past
      365 days was that which, immediately after the sinking of the <i>Lusitania</i>,
      showed us the full depths of the &ldquo;alien peril.&rdquo; Before the war we had had
      fifty thousand German-born persons living in our midst. They had enjoyed
      the whole freedom of our commerce, the whole justice of our law courts,
      and the whole protection of our police. Many of them had married our
      British women, who had borne them British children. Most of them had
      learned to speak our language, and some of us had learned to understand
      their own. A few had become British subjects, and many had been honoured
      by our King. Our music, literature, and art had become theirs. Shakespeare
      had, in effect, become a German poet, and Wagner a British composer. The
      barriers between our races had seemed to break down, and even such of us
      as had small hope of a golden age of universal brotherhood had begun to
      believe that marriage, mutual interest, education, and environment were
      making us one with these strangers within our gates.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came a startling awakening. We realized beyond possibility of doubt
      that many thousands of our German aliens had been keeping up a dual
      responsibility, and that the chief of their two duties had been duty to
      their own country. We found beyond question that a settled system of
      espionage was at work in Great Britain, under the direction of the German
      authorities; that information which could only be of use in the event of
      invasion had for many years been gathered up by some of the people whom we
      had called our friends, and that day by day and hour by hour, as the war
      went on, secrets valuable to our enemy had been filtering through to
      Germany from influential places in this country.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a shock to our sense of security, our pride, and even our
      self-respect! The horror of the discovery reached its highest point at the
      time of the sinking of the great liner, for then it was realized that
      there could be no limit to the expression of German cruelty. It is one of
      the effects of the spirit of cruelty to strike its victims with moral
      blindness. If it were possible that the German conscience could justify
      murder on the sea, why should it not justify it on land? Why should not
      our German governesses burn down the houses in which our children lay
      asleep? Why should not a German secretary attempt to assassinate one of
      our public ministers? War was war, and whatever was necessary was right.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are doing wrong, but it is necessary to do wrong, and necessity knows
      no law.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      HYMNS OF HATE
    </h2>
    <p>
      About this time also we became conscious of a fierce, delirious,
      intoxicating hate of our people which was developing in the hearts of our
      enemies. Before the outbreaking of the war it had been Russia and the
      Russians who had (by inherited antipathy from the founder of the German
      Empire) been the chief objects of German hatred. Now it was Britain and
      the British. Hymns of Hate (our enemies called it &ldquo;sacred hate&rdquo;) were
      composed, recited, and sung:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     French and Russian, they matter not,
     A blow for a blow, and a shot for a shot,
     We love them not, we hate them not,
     We love as one, we hate as one,
     We have one foe, and one alone&mdash;
                    England!
</pre>
    <p>
      England was not moved to retaliate in kind. We remembered what the German
      Churchmen had said about our Teutonic brotherhood, and allowed ourselves
      to believe that this was only the call of the blood in the German race&mdash;the
      mad, bad blood of fratricidal hate, the most devilish hate of all. We also
      reflected that it was a form of hatred not unfamiliar in asylums for the
      insane, where it has always been equally tragic and pitiful in its
      effects, and certain to recoil on the sufferer&rsquo;s own head. But as no sane
      father of a family would make free of his children&rsquo;s nursery the deranged
      relative who required the protection and restraint of the padded room, we
      decided that there was only one safe way with our aliens as a whole&mdash;to
      shut them up. God forbid that any of us should say that all our German
      aliens were under suspicion of criminal intentions. On the contrary, we
      know that some of them are among the sincere friends of Great Britain,
      passionately opposing Germany&rsquo;s objects in this war and loathing Germany&rsquo;s
      methods. We know, too, that a few belong to that rare company whose
      sympathies can rise even higher than nationality into the realm of &ldquo;human
      empire.&rdquo; We also know that countless persons, long resident in this
      country, and deeply attached to the land of their adoption, have suffered
      unspeakable hardships from the accident of German origin. It is painful to
      think of some of the people who frequented our houses, whose houses we
      frequented, whose wives and children are our kindred, being shut up behind
      barbed wire in open encampments. But these are among the inevitable
      cruelties of a war for which we are not responsible. In putting the great
      body of our enemy aliens under control we did no more than our plain duty
      to the soldiers who were fighting for us at the front. What will happen to
      them (and us) when the war is over, and they come out of their prisons,
      none can say. It seems as if the world can never be the same place as
      before&mdash;the devil has played too hard a game with it.

    <h2>
      THE PART PLAYED BY RUSSIA
    </h2>
    <p>
      And then Russia! Distance from the scene of action, the great length of
      the line of operations and the vast area behind it have made it difficult
      or impossible for us to see the drama of the Russian campaign as we have
      seen that of France, Belgium, and our own Empire. But we have seen
      something, and it has been enough to give the lie to certain of the
      emphatic protestations with which Germany made war. We had heard it said
      by the German Chancellor that the fact that Russia was mobilizing in those
      last days of July 1914 made it impossible for Germany to ask Austria to
      extend the time-limit imposed upon Serbia&mdash;a time-limit which would
      have been indecent among civilized people if it had concerned nothing more
      serious than the destruction of a kennel of dogs suspected of rabies. But
      all the world knows now that Russian mobilization was a process inevitably
      so slow that the German armies had flung themselves upon Belgium twelve
      days before the Russian advance began.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then we had heard it said by the German Churchmen that in taking the side
      of Russia we, British and French people, leaders among the enlightened
      races, were helping Muscovite barbarians to oppose the cause of
      civilization. But since Louvain, Termonde, and Rheims, not to speak of the
      unnameable iniquities of Liège, the world knows where the barbaric spirit
      of Europe had its central home&mdash;in Berlin, not in Petrograd; in the
      proud hearts of the German over-lords, not the meek ones of the Russian
      peasantry.

    <h2>
      THE SHADOW OF THE GREAT DEATH
    </h2>
    <p>
      The truth, as everybody knows who knows Russia, is that &ldquo;barbarous,&rdquo; the
      classic taunt of the German against Russia, is, of all words, the least
      proper as a description of the Russian mind and character. I have myself
      been only once in Russia, but it was on a long visit and under conditions
      which were calculated, beyond anything that has happened since down to
      to-day, to reveal to me the whole secret of the Russian soul, In 1892,
      when the cholera had come sweeping up from the south, I travelled for
      weeks that seemed like an eternity in the little towns of Galicia and the
      cities beyond the Russian frontier. The Great Death darkened my sky over
      many hundreds of miles of travel. I visited the plague spots where men&rsquo;s
      lives were being mown down at the devastating stride of 5000 deaths a
      week, and where men&rsquo;s hearts, the nerve, courage, sanity, and humanity of
      men, were being sapped and quenched and consumed by terror and panic and
      despair. I saw the Russian people under the black shadow and in the malign
      presence of the Great Death, living in the dark clouds of inquietude and
      dread and awe. And when my visit came to an end I left Russia with the
      feeling that, relatively short as my life among the Russian people had
      been, I knew them because I had been with them when their very souls lay
      bare.
    </p>
    <p>
      What, then, did I see? A barbaric people? No, a thousand times, no! I saw
      an uneducated people; a neglected people; a people badly fed, badly
      housed, and badly protected from the cruelties of a rigorous climate; but
      not a people who had naturally one barbaric impulse, if by that we mean
      the &ldquo;will to life&rdquo; which animates the savage man. And I now say, with all
      the emphasis of which I am capable, that the last reproach that can
      rightly be flung at the Russian people, even the least enlightened of
      them, the Russian peasants, in the darkest reaches of their vast country,
      is that they are barbarians. Deeds of cruelty and of barbarity there may
      be among the Russians, as there are among all peoples, and the
      dehumanizing conditions inevitable to warfare may perhaps increase the
      number of them, but the outrages of Louvain, Termonde, Rheims and Liège
      are morally and physically impossible to the Russian race.

    <h2>
      THE RUSSIAN SOUL
    </h2>
    <p>
      The truth is, too, that there is not in the world a more religious people
      than the Russian&mdash;a people more submissive to what they conceive (not
      always wisely) to be the will of the Almighty, the governance of the
      unseen forces. As opposed to the average German intellect, which for the
      past fifty years has been struggling day and night to materialize the
      spiritual, the Russian intellect seems to be always trying to spiritualize
      the material. No one can doubt this who has seen the Russian peasants on
      their pathetic pilgrimages to the Holy Land, standing (among the lepers,
      uttering their clamorous lamentations) before the gates of the Garden of
      Gethsemane, or trooping in dense crowds down the steep steps to the
      underground Church of the Virgin. The literature of Russia, too, reflects
      this trait of the Russian soul, and not only in the works of Pushkin,
      Gogol, Tourgeneiff, Tolstoy, Repin, Dostoyevsky, and Glinka, or yet in
      Kuprine, Gorki, Anoutchin, Merejkowsky, and Baranovsky, but in those
      simpler and perhaps cruder writings which speak directly to uneducated
      minds, the same striving after the spiritual is everywhere to be seen.
      Books like Treitschke&rsquo;s, Nietzsche&rsquo;s, and Bernhardi&rsquo;s would be impossible
      in Russia, not, heaven knows, because of their &ldquo;intellectual superiority,&rdquo;
       which is another name for braggadocio, but because of their moral
      insensibility, their glorification of the physical forces of the body of
      man, which the Russian mind sets lower than the unseen powers of his soul.

    <h2>
      THE RUSSIAN MOUJIK MOBILIZING
    </h2>
    <p>
      So the flashes as of lightning that have shown us the part Russia has
      played in the drama of the past 365 days have revealed a people acting
      under something very like a religious impulse. We have seen the moujiks
      being mobilized in remote parts of the vast country, and have found it a
      moving picture. It is probable that the war had been going on for weeks
      before they heard anything about it. Almost certainly they had no clear
      idea of where the fighting was, or what it was about, the theatre of the
      struggle being so far away and their ignorance of the world outside their
      own little communities so profound and impenetrable. We may be sure that
      when the echo of the great war did at length reach them it was quite
      undisturbed by any foolish pretence associated with the assassination of
      the Archduke Ferdinand (that lie could only be expected to impose on the
      enlightened peoples of the West) and concerned itself solely with the
      safety of Russia. The humblest Russian is proud of Russia; proud that it
      is so big and powerful among the nations of the world. He will gladly die
      rather than see it made less, so deep is his devotion to the
      long-suffering giant whose blood is throbbing in his veins.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore when the call of war came to the moujiks in their far-off homes,
      we saw them answering it as if it had been the call of their faith. First
      a service in the village church; then a procession behind the village pope
      to the village shrine (&ldquo;Now go away and fight for Russia, my children&rdquo;),
      then the setting off for the distant railway station, the mothers and
      young wives of the soldiers marching for miles by their sides, carrying
      their rifles and haversacks along the wide roads white with dust. What
      scenes of human pathos! For a long time the officers are indulgent to
      irregularities&mdash;have they not just left their own dear women behind
      them?&mdash;but at length the word of command rings out, and everybody not
      connected with the army has to go back. Ah, those partings! Still, God is
      good! And hadn&rsquo;t Masha promised to burn a candle to the Virgin every day
      while her husband is away? Ivan will come back; yes, of course Ivan will
      come back, and by that time baby will be born, and then what joy, what
      lifelong happiness!

    <h2>
      HOW THE RUSSIANS MAKE WAR
    </h2>
    <p>
      From some of the greater cities of Western Russia there came flashes of
      similar scenes. The memory of that time of the cholera is closely involved
      for me in the thought of these tragic days, and by the light of what I saw
      in Kief, in Sosnowitz, in Lublin, in Cracow, in Warsaw, and along the line
      of front in poor, stricken Poland, where, as I write, men are being mown
      down like grass, I seem to see what took place there at the beginning of
      August 1914, and is taking place now. I see the churches crowded and the
      congregations trailing out through the open porches into the churchyards
      around them. Old men and women who are too lame to struggle their way
      through the throng are lying under the open windows with their sticks and
      crutches stretched out beside them. Others outside are on their knees,
      following the services as they proceed within, clasping their hands,
      making the sign of the Cross, giving the responses, and joining in the
      singing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inside the churches, where the women kneel on one side in their bright
      cotton head-scarves and the soldiers on the other in their long, dark
      coats, prayers are being said for Russia, that God will protect her and
      her &ldquo;little Father,&rdquo; the Tsar, and all his faithful children, making the
      dark cloud that is on their horizon to pass them by unharmed. From porch
      to chancel they bend forward with their faces as near to the floor as
      their close crowding will permit. Then they sing. No one who has not been
      to Russia has ever heard such singing&mdash;no, not even in Rome in the
      Church of the Gesu as the clock strikes midnight on the last day of the
      year. There is no organ, and if there is a choir its voices are lost in
      the deep swell of the melancholy wail that rises from the people. Perhaps
      the morning is a bright one, and the sun is shining in dusty sheets of
      dancing light through the clerestory windows on to the altar ablaze with
      gold, twinkling behind its yellow candles and the bowed heads of the
      priests. When the service ends the soldiers form up in lines and march out
      through the kneeling crowds within and the overflowing congregations lying
      prone outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      So do the Russians make war. Not generally to the beating of drums, or yet
      the singing of their searching national anthem, and assuredly not as
      bloodhounds hunting for prey, but in the spirit of a simple people, often
      humble in their ignorance but always strong in their faith&mdash;in the
      certainty that there is something else in God&rsquo;s world besides greed and
      gold, something higher than &ldquo;the will to power,&rdquo; something better for a
      nation than to enlarge its empire, and that is to possess its soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now in their hour of trial let us salute our brave Allies in the East.
      Let us assure them of the sincerity of our alliance. We rejoice in their
      victories. We count their triumphs as our own. When we hear of their
      reverses our hearts are full. We feel that out of the storm of battle a
      great new spirit has been born into Russia, awakening her from a sleep of
      centuries. We feel, too, that a great new spirit of brotherhood has been
      born into the world, uniting the scattered and divided parts of it, and
      that there is no more moving manifestation of the unity of mankind than
      the fact that the Russian and British peoples, after long years of
      misunderstanding, are now fighting for the same cause from opposite sides
      of Europe. May they soon meet and clasp hands!

    <h2>
      THE PART PLAYED BY POLAND
    </h2>
    <p>
      And then Poland. Down to the end of the first year of war the part played
      by Poland has been that of absolute martyr. Like the water-mill in Zola&rsquo;s
      story she has first been disabled by the attack of her enemies and then
      destroyed by the defence of her friends. Three times the armies of the
      belligerents have rolled over her, and now that they are gone she lies
      stricken afresh, even yet more fiercely, under the famine and pestilence
      which have stalked in the wake of war.
    </p>
    <p>
      No more pitiful and abject picture does the terrible conflict present.
      Without part or lot in the European quarrel, with little to gain and
      everything to lose by it, having no such right of choice as gave glory to
      the martyrdom of Belgium, Poland has had nothing to do but to endure.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the beginning of the war, when the battery of Gerrman hatred was
      directed chiefly against Russia, the world was told that the measure of
      her barbarity was to be seen in the condition to which the Polish people
      had been reduced under Russian rule. But did the Harnacks, Hauptmanns,
      Ballins and von Bülows who put forth this plea, count on our ignorance of
      Galicia, in which the condition of the Poles is immeasurably more wretched
      under the rule of their Ally, Austria?
    </p>
    <p>
      In the fateful year 1892 I travelled much in Galicia, and saw something of
      the effects of Austrian government. My impressions of both were
      unfavorable. From points of natural wealth and beauty, Galicia is perhaps,
      of all countries, the least favoured of God. Shut out from the warm
      southern winds by the Carpathian mountains, and exposed to the northern
      blasts that sweep down from the broad steppes of Russia, the long and
      narrow stretch of Galician territory is probably the most inhospitable
      region in the western world Flat and featureless; with swampy and
      ague-stricken plains, unbroken by trees and hedges; with roads like
      canals, dissecting dreary wastes, black in the south, where the loam lies,
      light in the north where salt is found; with rivers without banks fraying
      into pools and ponds and marshes; with soppy fields in formal stripes like
      the patches of a patchwork quilt; with villages of log-houses, each having
      its cemetery a little apart, and its wooden crucifix like a gibbet at a
      space beyond&mdash;such is a great part of Galicia, the Polish province of
      Austria.
    </p>
    <p>
      But little as Nature has done to cheer the spirits of the Poles, who live
      under Austrian rule, what man has done is less. It is nothing at all, or
      worse than nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thickly-sown on the eastern frontier are many densely populated
      manufacturing towns, ugly and squat, and giving the effect of standing
      barefoot on the damp earth. As you walk through them they look like
      interminable lines of featureless streets, full of those sweating,
      screaming, squabbling masses of humanity that take away all your pride in
      the dignity of man&rsquo;s estate. The prevailing colour is yellow, the dominant
      odour is noxious, the thoroughfares are narrow, and often unpaved. In the
      busier quarters the shops are sometimes spacious, but more frequently they
      are mere slits in the monotonous façades. When closed, as on Sunday, these
      slits give the appearance of a row of prison cells. When open they present
      crude pictures on the inner faces of their doors&mdash;pictures of boots,
      caps, trousers, stockings or corsets, a typology which seems to be more
      necessary than words to inhabitants who have not, as a whole, been taught
      to read.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then the people themselves! Perhaps there is not in all the world a
      more hopeless-looking race, with their lagging lower lips, their dull grey
      eyes, their dosy, helpless, exanimate expression, suggesting that the body
      is half asleep and the spirit no more than half awake. To see them
      slouching along the streets, or sitting in stupefied groups at the doors
      of brandy-shops, passing a single bottle from mouth to mouth, is to
      realize how low humanity may fall in its own esteem under the rule of an
      alien government. To watch them at prayer in their little Catholic
      churches is to feel that they have been made to think of themselves as the
      least of God&rsquo;s creatures, unworthy to come to His footstool&mdash;always
      ready to kiss the earth, and never daring to lift their eyes to heaven,
      having no right, and hardly any hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such are the poorer and more degraded of the Poles in the Austrian
      crownland of Galicia, which has lately been swept by war (along the banks
      of the Vistula, the Dniester, and the Bug), and is now perishing of
      hunger, and being devastated by disease. And when I ask myself what has
      been the root-cause of a degradation so deep in a people who once laboured
      for the humanities of the world and upheld the traditions of Culture, I
      find only one answer&mdash;the suppression of nationality! In that fact
      lies the moral of Galicia&rsquo;s martyrdom. Let Belgium&rsquo;s nationality be
      suppressed as Germany is now trying to suppress it, and her condition will
      soon be like that of Austrian Poland. You cannot expect to keep the body
      of a nation alive while you are doing your best to destroy its soul.

      THE SOUL OF POLAND
    </h2>
    <p>
      It is a fearful thing to murder, or attempt to murder, the soul of a
      nation. The call that comes to a people&rsquo;s heart from the soil that gave
      them birth is a spiritual force which no conquering empire should dare to
      kill. How powerful it is, how mysterious, how unaccountable, and how
      infinitely pathetic! The land of one&rsquo;s country may be so bleak, so bare,
      so barren, that the stranger may think God can never have intended that it
      should be trodden by the foot of man, yet it seems to us, who were born to
      it, to be the fairest spot the sun shines upon. The songs of one&rsquo;s country
      may be the simplest staves that ever shaped themselves into music, yet
      they search our hearts as the loftiest compositions never can. The
      language of one&rsquo;s country (even the dialect of one&rsquo;s district) may be the
      crudest corruption that ever lived on human lips, yet it lights up dark
      regions of our consciousness which the purest of the classic tongues can
      never reach. Do we not all feel this, whatever the qualities or defects of
      our native speech&mdash;every Scotsman, every Irishman, every Welshman,
      nay, every Yorkshireman, every Lancashireman, every Devonshireman, when he
      hears the word and the tone which belong to his own people only? There are
      phrases in the Manx and the Anglo-Manx of my own little race which I can
      never hear spoken without the sense of something tingling and throbbing
      between my flesh and my skin. Why? Because it is the home-speech of my own
      island, and whatever she is, whatever fate may befall her, however she may
      treat me, she is my mother and I am her son.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such is the mighty and mysterious thing which we call a nation&rsquo;s soul.
      Nobody can explain it, nobody can account for it, but woe to the
      presumptuous empire which tries to wipe it out. It can never be wiped out.
      Crushed and trodden on it may be, as Austria has crushed and trodden on
      the soul of Austrian Poland, and as Germany has crushed and trodden on the
      soul of Prussian Poland, when they have fallen so low in the scale of
      civilized peoples as to flog Polish school children for refusing to learn
      their catechism and say their prayers in a language which they cannot
      understand. But to kill the soul of a nation is impossible. The German
      Chancellor could not do that when he violated the body of Belgium. And
      though Warsaw has fallen the fatuous Prince Leopold of Bavaria, with his
      preposterous proclamations, cannot kill the soul of Poland.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Cracow in 1892 I tried to buy for one of my children the little Polish
      national cap, but after a vain search for it through many shops (where I
      was generally suspected of being a spy for the Austrian police), the cap
      was brought to me at night, in my private room, by shopkeepers who had
      been afraid to sell it openly in the day. At Wieliezhe, I, with some forty
      persons of various nationalities (including the usual contingent of
      detectives), descended the immense and marvellous salt-mine which is now
      used as a show place for visitors. After passing, by the flare of torches,
      down long galleries of underground workings, we were plunged into darkness
      by a rush of wind over a subterranean river through which we had to
      shoulder our way on a raft. Then suddenly, no face being visible in that
      black tunnel under the earth, the Polish part of our company broke into a
      wild, fierce, frenzied singing of their national anthem which, in those
      days, they dare not sing on the surface and in the light: &ldquo;Poland is not
      lost for ever; she will live once more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No, Poland is not lost for ever! She will live once more!

    <h2>
      THE OLD SOLDIER OF LIBERTY
    </h2>
    <p>
      And Italy! Although it is only since May that Italy has stood by our side
      on the battle-front, in an effort to avert from the world a new military
      domination, we have known from the beginning that her heart was with the
      Allies, and she was willing to stake all, when her time came, for the same
      principles of humanity and freedom. A Roman friend tells me that he heard
      an Italian statesman say, &ldquo;Italy always meant war.&rdquo; We can well believe
      it. We have believed it from the first. On one of the early days of
      August, when a British regiment was passing through the streets of London
      on its way to Charing Cross, it was noticed that an old man in a red shirt
      and a peaked cap was marching with a proud step by the side of our
      soldiers. He turned out to be a Garibaldian, who had been living many
      years in Soho. Having dug up from his time-eaten trunk the simple
      regimentals of the army of the Liberator, he had come out to walk with our
      boys on the first stage of their journey to France. In the person of that
      old soldier of liberty we saw and saluted Italy&mdash;Italy that had known
      what it was to make her own sacrifices for the right, and was now ready to
      show us her sympathy in this supreme crisis in our history.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she had a trying, almost a tragic, time. For ten long months she lay
      under the quivering wing of war, in danger of attack from our enemies, and
      liable to misunderstanding among ourselves. She was party to a Triple
      Alliance which, ironically enough, bound her (up to a point) to her
      historic adversary, Austria, as well as to that Germany whose emperors had
      again and again sent their legions south in vain efforts to rule even the
      papacy from across the Rhine.
    </p>
    <p>
      How that alliance came to be made, and remade, against the sympathies and
      aspirations of a free people is one of the mysteries of diplomacy which
      Italian history has yet to solve. Perhaps there was corruption; perhaps
      there was nothing worse than honest blundering; perhaps the frequent
      spectacular visits to Rome of the Kaiser William (who is almost Oriental
      in his &ldquo;sense of the theatre,&rdquo; and knows better, perhaps, than any
      European sovereign since Napoleon how to apply it to real life) played
      upon the eyes of the Italian race, always susceptible to grandiose
      exhibitions of power and splendour. But we cannot forget the old Austrian
      sore, and we remember what Antonelli is reported to have said to Pius IX
      before the outbreak of the campaign of 1859: &ldquo;Holy Father, if the Italians
      do not go out to fight Austria, I believe, on my honour, the nuns will do
      so.&rdquo;

    </div>
    <h2>
      THE PART PLAYED BY ITALY
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Triple Alliance was a secret document, but everybody knew that it
      required Italy to join with Austria and Germany in the event of their
      being compelled to engage in a defensive war. Therefore the first question
      for Italy was whether the war declared by Austria against Serbia and by
      Germany against Belgium, although apparently aggressive, was in reality
      defensive. There was a further question for Italy&mdash;what would happen
      to her if she decided against her Allies? She did decide against them,
      thereby giving the lie direct to the Harnacks, Hauptmanns, Ballins, and
      von Bülows who had been telling the neutral nations that the war had been
      forced upon Germany. By all the laws of nations Germany and Austria ought
      then, if they had honestly believed their own story, to have declared war
      on Italy. They preferred to wheedle her, to try to buy her, bribe her,
      corrupt her, body and soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      They failed. After flooding the peninsula with lying literature, directed
      chiefly against ourselves, Germany sent back to the Italian capital its
      most astute statesman, who was married to a much-admired Italian woman. It
      was all in vain. Italy knew her own mind and had made reckoning with her
      own heart. She had begun with contempt for the nation which could invade
      Serbia, under the pretence of avenging the murder of the Archduke
      Ferdinand, and with loathing for the other nation which could violate
      Belgium after it had sworn to protect her, and now she went on to hatred
      and horror of the perpetrators of the outrages in Liège, in Louvain, and
      in Rheims, that were scorching men&rsquo;s eyes in the name of war.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, Italy, although separating herself from her former allies, was not
      yet taking sides against them. Why? If their war was an aggressive and
      unjustifiable one, why could not Italy say so at once with her sword as
      well as her pen? There was a period of uncertainty, impatience, even of
      misunderstanding among her own people. Whispers reached them that their
      King had said (he never had) that he had given his &ldquo;kingly word&rdquo; for it
      that if Italy could not fight with her former friends she should not fight
      against them. This was a blow to Italian aspirations, for Victor Emmanuel
      III is the best-beloved man in Italy, the father of his people, whose
      heads would bow before his will even though their hearts were torn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came negotiations with Austria about the restoration of provinces
      which had once belonged to Italy and were still inhabited by Italians. It
      looked like paltering and peddling, like sale and barter. The people were
      losing patience; they thought time was being wasted. Beyond the Alps men
      were dying for liberty in a mighty struggle against the worst tyranny that
      had ever threatened the world, yet Italy was doing nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the people did not know all. Even then their country was already at
      war within the limits of her own frontier&mdash;silently in her tailors&rsquo; 
      workshops, where uniforms were being sewn for the immense army she was
      soon to call into the field, audibly in the forges of Milan and Terni,
      where vast quantities of munitions were being hammered out for a long
      campaign.

    <h2>
      HOW THE WAR ENTERED ITALY
    </h2>
    <p>
      Then, by one of the most vivid, if pathetic, of the flashes as of
      lightning that have shown us the drama of the past 365 days, we saw the
      actual war come to Italy. It came in a profoundly impressive form&mdash;the
      dead body of young Bruno Garibaldi, grandson of the Liberator. Fighting
      for France, Bruno had fallen in a gallant charge at the front, and his
      brother, who was by his side, had carried his body out of the trenches and
      brought it home. We who know Rome do not need to be told how it was
      received there. We can see the dense mass of uncovered heads in the Piazza
      delle Terme, stretching from the doors of the railway station to the
      bronze fountain at the top of the Via Nazionale, and we can hear the deep
      swell of the Garibaldian hymn, which comes like a challenge as well as a
      moan from 50,000 throats. Not for the first time was a dead Garibaldi
      being borne through the streets of Rome, and those of us who remembered
      the earlier day knew well that with the body of this Italian boy the war
      had entered Italy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, at a crisis in Italy&rsquo;s internal government, our enemy, having failed
      to buy, bribe, or corrupt Italy, began to threaten her. Out of the
      delirium of his intoxicated conscience, which no longer shrank from crime,
      he told Italy that if she dared to break her neutrality her fate should be
      as the fate of Belgium. That frightened some of us for a moment. We
      thought of Venice, of Florence, of Assisi, of Subiaco, of Naples, and of
      Rome, and, remembering the methods by which Germany was beating and
      bludgeoning her way through the war, our hearts trembled and thrilled at a
      dreadful vision of the lovely and beloved Italian land under the heel of a
      ruthless aggressor&mdash;of the destruction of the history of Christendom
      as it had been written by great artists on canvas and by great architects
      in stone through the long calendar of nearly two thousand years. But we
      also thought of Savoy, of Palestro, of Cas-ale, of Caprera, and of &ldquo;Roma o
      morte,&rdquo; and told ourselves that, come what might, victory or defeat, the
      children of Victor Emmanuel III would never allow themselves to buy the
      ease and safety of their bodies by the corruption and degradation of their
      souls.

    </div>
    <h2>
      THE ITALIAN SOUL
    </h2>
    <p>
      That was the great and awful hour when Italy stood on the threshold of her
      fate; but though Great Britain&rsquo;s heart was bleeding from the sacrifices
      she had already made, and had still to make, and though Italy&rsquo;s
      intervention meant so much to us, we did not feel that we had a right to
      ask for it. And neither was it necessary that we should do so. The treaty
      that bound Italy to England was not written on a scrap of paper. It was in
      our blood, born of our devotion to humanity, to justice, to liberty, and
      to the memory of our great men. Therefore, with the world in arms about
      her, let Italy do what she thought best for herself, and the bond between
      us would not be broken!
    </p>
    <p>
      How the sequel has justified our faith! And when the great hour struck at
      last, after ten months of suspense, and Italy&mdash;ready, fully equipped,
      united&mdash;found the voice with which she proclaimed war, what a voice
      it was! Eloquent voices she had had throughout, in her Press as well as in
      her legislative chambers&mdash;Morelli&rsquo;s, Barzini&rsquo;s, Albertini&rsquo;s,
      Malagodi&rsquo;s, not to speak of Sartorio&rsquo;s, Ferrero&rsquo;s, Annie Vivantes, and
      many more&mdash;but it quickens my pulse to remember that it was the voice
      of a poet which at the final moment was to speak for the Italian soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Friends newly arrived from Italy tell me that not even in Rome (where one
      always feels as if one were living on the borderland of the old world and
      the new, with thousands of years behind and thousands of years in front)
      can anybody remember anything so moving as the substance and the reception
      of Gabriele d&rsquo;Annunzio&rsquo;s speech from the balcony of the Hotel Regina. We
      can well imagine it. The spirit of Time itself could have found no greater
      scene, no more thrilling moment. The broad highway on the breast of the
      hill going up to the Porta Pinciana, faced by the palace of the Queen
      Mother and flanked by the gardens of the Capuchin monastery, with the
      Colosseum, the Capitol and the Forum almost visible to the right&mdash;what
      a theatre to speak in!
    </p>
    <p>
      There were 5000 persons below, all &ldquo;Romans of Rome,&rdquo; and the Queen Mother
      was on her balcony. But the orator was worthy of his audience, and his
      theme. He had the past for his prologue, and the future for his epilogue.
      Cæsar, Brutus, Cicero, the story of the old oppression from which the
      world had freed itself after agelong tribulation, and then a picture of
      the new tyranny that was sweeping down from across the Rhine. What wonder
      if the warm-hearted Roman populace, to whom patriotism is a religion, were
      carried away by an appeal which seemed to come to them with the voice of
      Dante, Mazzini, Carducci, and Garibaldi from the very earth beneath their
      feet!
    </p>
    <p>
      So on May 20,1915, knowing well what the terrors of war were, and how
      remote the prospects of early victory, Italy took her place in arms by the
      side of the Allies. And now the heart of old Rome, so long perturbed, is
      tranquil. With heroic confidence she relies on her brave sons, led by her
      dauntless King, to justify her. And when she hears the truculent boast of
      our enemy that after he has disposed of Russia, he will destroy Italy as a
      power in Europe, she answers calmly, &ldquo;Yes, when the last Roman capable of
      bearing arms lies dead in Roman soil&mdash;perhaps then, but not sooner.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      THE PART PLAYED BY THE NEUTRAL NATIONS
    </h2>
    <p>
      And then the neutral countries&mdash;what is the part which they have
      played in the drama of the past 365 days? I think I may fairly claim to
      have had better opportunities than most people for studying one aspect of
      it, its moral aspect, and therefore I trust I may be forgiven if I make a
      personal reference. Seeing, in the earliest days of the war, that Germany
      was doing her best to divert the eye of the world from the crime she had
      committed in Belgium, and being convinced that Britain&rsquo;s hope both now and
      in the future lay in keeping the world&rsquo;s eye fixed on that outrage, I
      moved the proprietors of the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> to the publication of
      &ldquo;King Albert&rsquo;s Book.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What that great book was it must be quite unnecessary to say, but it may
      be permitted to the editor to claim that it constituted the first (as it
      may well be the final) impeachment of the Kaiser before the bar of the
      nations for a crime in Belgium as revolting as that of Frederick the Great
      in Silesia and a thousandfold more fatal. After the publication of &ldquo;King
      Albert&rsquo;s Book,&rdquo; Germany knew that before the tribunal of the civilized
      world she stood tried and condemned. But though representative men and
      women in thirteen different countries united within the covers of the
      historic volume to express their abhorrence of Germany&rsquo;s iniquity, the
      whole weight of the world&rsquo;s condemnation could not be included.
    </p>
    <p>
      From many of the neutral nations there came pathetic cries of inability to
      join in the general protest. Famous men wrote that the neutrality of their
      countries imposed upon them the duty and the penalty of silence. &ldquo;My
      brother is a member of our Government,&rdquo; wrote one illustrious man of
      letters, &ldquo;and if I am not to get him into trouble I must hold my tongue.&rdquo;
       Another, whose German name, if it could be published, would carry weight
      throughout the world, said: &ldquo;I know where my sympathy lies, and so do you,
      but I dare not speak, for I am a German-born subject, and to tell what is
      in my mind would be treason to my country.&rdquo; This message came from a
      remote place in Spain, the writer having been compelled to fly from
      France, because his blood was German, while unable to take refuge in
      Germany because his heart was French.

    <h2>
      THE PART PLAYED BY THE UNITED STATES
    </h2>
    <p>
      Perhaps the most tragic of these vistas of the sufferings of great souls
      in neutral countries came from the United States. Profoundly affecting
      were nearly all President Wilson&rsquo;s public utterances, even when, as
      sometimes occurred, our sympathy could not follow them. And certainly one
      of the most vivid of the flashes as of lightning, whereby we have seen the
      war in its moral aspect, was that which showed us the United States, at
      his proclamation, arresting for a whole day, on October 4, 1914, the
      immense and tumultuous activities of her vast continent in order to
      intercede with the Almighty to vouchsafe healing peace to His striving
      children.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a great and impressive spectacle. As I think of it I seem to feel
      the quieting of the headlong thoroughfares of Chicago, the hushing of the
      thud and drum of the overhead railways in New York, and then the slow
      ringing of the bells in the square tower of that old Puritan Church in
      Boston&mdash;all calm and peaceful now as a New England village on Sunday
      morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      But truth to tell we of the belligerent countries were not deeply moved or
      comforted by America&rsquo;s prayers. We thought our cause was that of humanity,
      and the sure way to establish it was by protest as well as prayer. We did
      not ask or desire that America should take up arms by our side. We did not
      wish to enlarge the area of the conflict that was deluging Europe in
      blood. Confident in the justice of our cause, we thought we knew that by
      the help of the Lord of Hosts, and by the strength of His stretched-out
      arm, the forces of the Allies would be sufficient for themselves. Neither
      did we wish to make a parade of our wounds to excite America&rsquo;s pity. With
      all our souls we believed that for every drop of innocent blood that was
      being shed outside the recognized area of battle the Avenger of blood
      would yet exact an awful penalty. But when humanity was being openly
      outraged, and conventions to which America had set her seal were being
      flagrantly violated, we thought, with Mr. Roosevelt, that it was the duty
      of the United States, as a Christian country, to step in with the
      expression of her deep and just indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      America was long in doing that. But, thank God, she did it at last, and
      for the courage and strength of the Notes which President Wilson (speaking
      with a voice that is no unworthy echo of the great one that spoke at
      Gettysburg) has lately sent to Germany on the sinking of the <i>Lusitania</i>,
      and the outrage thereby committed on the laws of justice and humanity,
      which are immutable, the whole civilized world (outside the countries of
      our enemies) now salutes the United States in respect and reverence.

    <h2>
      THE THUNDERCLAP THAT FELL ON ENGLAND
    </h2>
    <p>
      Among the flashes as of lightning that revealed to us the drama of the
      past 365 days, some of the most vivid were those that lit up the condition
      at home towards the end of Spring. The war had been going on ten months
      when it fell on our ears like a thunderclap that all was not well with us
      in England. In the ominous unrest that followed there was danger of
      serious division, with the risk of a breakdown in that national unity
      without which there could be no true strength. The result was a Coalition
      Government, uniting all the parties save one, followed by an appeal to the
      patriotism of the people through their purse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never before had Great Britain witnessed such a response to her call. The
      first Cabinet in England that aimed at coalition had broken down in
      personal corruption, but the Cabinet now called into being was beyond the
      suspicion of even party interest. The first appeal to the purse of the
      British people had yielded one hundred and thirty millions in a year, but
      the appeal now made yielded six hundred millions in a month. It was almost
      as if Great Britain had ceased to be a nation and become a family.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor did the industries of the country, in spite of the lure of drink and
      the temptation to strikes, fall behind the spirit of the people. At the
      darkest moment of our inquietude the call of health took me for a tour in
      a motor-car over fifteen hundred miles of England, and though my journey
      lay through three or four of the least industrial and most placid of our
      counties, I found evidences of effort on every hand, The high roads were
      the track of marching armies of men in training; the broad moors were
      armed camps; the little towns were recruiting stations or depots for
      wagons of war; the land lay empty of workers with the hay crop still
      standing for want of hands to cut it, and the villages seemed to be
      deserted save by little children and the feeble, old men, who had nothing
      left to do but to wait for death.
    </p>
    <p>
      The voice of the great war had been heard everywhere. From the remote
      hamlet of Clovelly the young men of the lifeboat crew had left for the
      front, and if the call of the sea came now it would have to be answered by
      sailors over sixty. In Barnstaple two large boardings on the face of a
      public building recorded in golden letters the names of the townsmen who
      had joined the colours. In every little shop window along the high road to
      Bath there were portraits of the King, Kitchener, Jellicoe, French, and
      Joffre, flanked sometimes by pictures of poor, burnt and blackened
      Belgium.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the edge of Dartmoor, in Drake&rsquo;s old town, Tavistock, I saw a thrilling
      sight&mdash;thrilling yet simple and quite familiar. Eight hundred men
      were leaving for France. In the cool of the evening they drew up with
      their band, four square in the market-place under the grey walls of the
      parish church, a thousand years old. The men of a regiment remaining
      behind had come to see their comrades off, bringing their own band with
      them. For a short half-hour the two bands played alternately, &ldquo;Tipperary,&rdquo;
       &ldquo;Fall In,&rdquo; &ldquo;We Don&rsquo;t want to Lose You,&rdquo; and all the other homely but
      stirring ditties with which Tommy has cheered his soul. The open windows
      round the square were full of faces, the balconies were crowded, and some
      of the townspeople were perched on the housetops. Suddenly the church
      clock struck eight, the hour for departure; a bugle sounded; a loud voice
      gave the word of command like a shot out of a musket; it was repeated by a
      score of other sharp voices running down the line, and then the two bands,
      and the men, and all the people in the windows, on the balconies and on
      the roofs (except such of us as had choking throats) played and sang &ldquo;For
      Auld Lang Syne.&rdquo; Was the spirit of our mighty old Drake in his Tavistock
      town that day?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on, gentlemen, there&rsquo;s time to finish the game, and beat the
      Spaniards, too!&rdquo;

    <h2>
      A GLIMPSE OP THE KING&rsquo;S SON
    </h2>
    <p>
      One glimpse at the end of my little motor tour seemed to send a flash of
      light through the drama of the past 365 days. It was of our young Prince
      of Wales, home for a short holiday from the front. I had seen the King&rsquo;s
      son only once before&mdash;at his investiture in Carnarvon Castle. How
      long ago that seemed! In actual truth &ldquo;no human creature dreamt of war&rdquo;
       that day, although the shadow of it was even then hanging over our heads.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of us who have witnessed most of the great pageants of the world
      thought we had never seen the like of that spectacle&mdash;the grey old
      ruins, roofless and partly clothed by lichen and moss, the vast multitude
      of spectators, the brilliant sunshine, the booming of the guns from the
      warships in the bay outside, the screaming of the seagulls overhead, the
      massed Welsh choirs singing &ldquo;Land of my Fathers,&rdquo; and, above all, the boy
      of eighteen, beautiful as a fairy prince in his blue costume, walking hand
      in hand between the King and Queen to be presented to his people at the
      castle gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now he was home for a little while from that blackened waste across
      the sea, which had been trodden into desolation under the heel of a
      ruthless aggressor and was still shrieking as with the screams of hell. He
      had gone there willingly, eagerly, enthusiastically, doing the work and
      sharing the risk of every other soldier of the King, and he would go back,
      in another few days, although he had more to lose by going than any other
      young man on the battle-front&mdash;a throne.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if he lives to ascend it he will have his reward. England will not
      forget.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we hear people say that Great Britain is not yet awake to the fact
      that she is at war I wonder where they keep their eyes. If I had been a
      Rip Van Winkle, suddenly awakened after twenty years of sleep, or yet an
      inhabitant of Mars dropped down on our part of this planet, I think I
      should have known in any five minutes of any day since August 5, 1914,
      that Great Britain was at war. Such a spirit has never breathed through
      our Empire during my time, or yet through any other empire of which I have
      any knowledge. Everybody, or almost everybody, doing something for
      England, and few or none idle who are of military age except such as have
      heavy burdens or secret disabilities into which I dare not pry.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not alone in Flanders or on the North Sea that our country&rsquo;s battle
      is being fought, and when I think I hear the hammering on ten thousand
      anvils in the forges of Woolwich, Newcastle, and Glasgow, and the thud of
      picks in the coal and iron mines of Cardiff, Wigan, and Cleator Moor,
      where hundreds of thousands of men are working long shifts day and night,
      half-naked under the fierce heat of furnaces, sometimes half choked by the
      escaping fumes of fire-damp, I tell myself it is not for me, too old for
      active service and only able to use a pen, to dishonour England, and her
      Empire, in the presence of her Allies, or weaken her in the face of her
      enemies, by one word of complaint against the young manhood of my country.

    <h2>
      THE PART PLAYED BY WOMAN
    </h2>
    <p>
      The latest and perhaps the most vivid of the flashes as of lightning which
      have revealed the drama of the past 365 days has shown us the part played
      by woman. What a part that has been! Nearly always in the histories of the
      great world-wars of the past the sympathy of the spectator has been more
      or less diverted from the unrecorded martyrdom of the myriads of forgotten
      women who have lost sons and husbands by the machinations of the few vain
      and selfish women who have governed continents by playing upon the
      passions of men. Thank God, there has been nothing of that kind in this
      case. On the contrary, woman&rsquo;s part in this red year of the war has been
      one of purity, sacrifice, and undivided glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards the end of it we saw a procession through the streets of London of
      30,000 women who had come out to ask for the right to serve the State. I
      do not envy the man who, having eyes to see, a heart to feel, and a mind
      to comprehend, was able to look on that sight unmoved. Every class of
      woman was represented there, the gently-born, the educated, and the
      tenderly-nurtured, as well as the humbly-born, the uneducated, and the
      heavily-burdened, the woman with the delicate, spiritual face, as well as
      the woman with the face hardened by toil. And they were marching together,
      side by side, with all the barriers broken down. It was not so much a
      procession of British women as a demonstration of British womanhood, and
      it seemed to say, &ldquo;We hate war as no man can ever hate it, but it has been
      forced upon us all, so we, too, want to take our share in it.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      THE WORD OF WOMAN
    </h2>
    <p>
      But long before July 17, 1915, woman&rsquo;s part in this war began. It began on
      August 5, 1914, when the first hundred thousand of our voluntary army
      sprang into being as by a miracle. The miracle (if I am asked to account
      for it) had its origin in the word of woman. Without that word we should
      have had no Kitchener&rsquo;s Army, for &ldquo;on the decision of the women, above
      everything else, lay the issues of the men&rsquo;s choice.&rdquo; {*}
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The Times.
</pre>
    <p>
      It needs little imagination to lift, as it were, the roofs off a hundred
      homes, and see and hear what was going on there in those early days of the
      war, after the clear call went out over England, &ldquo;Your King and Country
      need you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the little house of a City clerk, married only a year before, the young
      wife is saying, &ldquo;Yes, I think you ought to go, dear. It&rsquo;s rather a pity,
      so soon after the boy was born... just as you were expecting a rise, too,
      and we were going to move into that nice cottage in the garden suburb.
      But, then, it will be all for the best, and you mustn&rsquo;t think of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Or perhaps it is early morning in the flat of a young lawyer on the day he
      has to leave for the front. He is dressed in his khaki, and his wife, who
      is busying about his breakfast, is rising to a sublime but heartbreaking
      cheerfulness for the last farewell. &ldquo;Nearly time for you to go, Robert, if
      you are to get to the barracks by six.... Betty? Oh, no, pity to waken
      her. I&rsquo;ll kiss her for you when she awakes and say daddy promised to bring
      her a dolly from France.... Crying? Of course not I Why should I be
      crying?... Good-bye then I Good-bye!...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Or perhaps it is evening in a great house in Belgravia, and Lady Somebody
      is saying adieu to her son. How well she remembers the day he was born! It
      was in May. The blossom was out on the lilacs in the square, and all the
      windows were open. How happy she had been! He had a long fever, too, when
      he was a child, and for three days Death had hovered over their house. How
      she had prayed that the dread shadow would pass away! It did, and now that
      her boy has grown to be a man he comes to her in his officer&rsquo;s uniform to
      say,... Ah, these partings! They are really the death-hours of their dear
      ones, and the women know it, although, like Andromache, they go on
      &ldquo;smiling through their tears.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With what brave and silent hearts they face the sequel too! The mother of
      Sub-Lieutenant So-and-So receives letters from him nearly every other
      week. Such cheerful little pencil scribblings! &ldquo;Dearest Mother, I have a
      jolly comfortable dug-out now&mdash;three planks and a truss of straw, and
      I sleep on it like a top.&rdquo; Or, perhaps, &ldquo;You see they have sent me back to
      the Base after six weeks under fire, and now I have a real, <i>real</i>
      room, and a real, <i>real</i> bed!&rdquo; The dear old darling! She puts her
      precious letters on the mantelpiece for everybody to see, and laughs over
      them all day long. But when night comes, and she is winding the clock
      before going upstairs, thinking of the boy who not so long ago used to
      sleep on her knees.... &ldquo;Ah, me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then the final trial, the last tragic test&mdash;the women are equal
      to that also. First, the letter in the large envelope from the War Office:
      &ldquo;Dear Madam, the Secretary of State regrets to inform you that Lieutenant
      So-and-So is reported killed in action on... Lord Kitchener begs to offer
      you...&rdquo; And then, a little later, from the royal palace: &ldquo;The King and
      Queen send you their most sincere....&rdquo; Oh, if she could only go out to the
      place where they have laid... But then the Lord will know where to find
      His Own!
    </p>
    <p>
      Somebody in Paris said the other day, &ldquo;No one will ever make our women cry
      any, more&mdash;after the war.&rdquo; All the springs of their tears will be
      dry.

    <h2>
      THE NEW SCARLET LETTER
    </h2>
    <p>
      It is brave in a man to face death on the battlefield, instantaneous
      death, or, what is worse, death after long suffering, after lying between
      trenches, perhaps, on the &ldquo;no-man&rsquo;s ground&rdquo; which neither friend nor foe
      can reach, grasping the earth in agony, seeing the dark night coming on,
      and then dying in the cold shiver of the dawn. Yes, it is brave in a man
      to face death like that. But perhaps it is even braver in a woman to face
      life, with three or four fatherless children to provide for, on nothing
      but the charity of the State. Then battle is in the blood of man, and the
      heroic part falls to him by right, but it is not in the blood of woman,
      who shrinks from it and loathes it, and yet such is her nature, the fine
      and subtle mystery of it, that she flies to the scene of suffering with a
      bravery which far out-strips that of the man-at-arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the breasts that have borne tens of thousands of the sons who have
      fallen in this war the Red Cross is now enshrined. It is the new scarlet
      letter&mdash;the badge not of shame, but glory. And &ldquo;through the rolling
      of the drums&rdquo; and the thundering of the guns a voice comes to us in this
      year of service and sacrifice whose message no one can mistake. Woman, who
      faces death every time she brings a man-child into the world, must
      henceforth know what is to be done with him. It is her right, her natural
      right, and the part she has taken in this war has proved it.

    <h2>
      AND... AFTER?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Such is the drama of the war as I have seen it. How far it has gone, when
      it will close and the curtain fall on it none of us can say. With five
      millions already dead, twice as many wounded, one kingdom in ruins,
      another desolate from disease, the larger part of Europe under arms, civil
      life paralysed, social existence overshadowed by a mourning that enters
      into nearly every household; with a war still in progress compared with
      which all other wars sink into insignificance; with a public debt which
      Pitt, Fox, and Burke (who thought £240,000,000 frightful) would have
      considered certain to sink the ship of State; with taxation such as our
      fathers never conceived possible&mdash;what will be our condition when
      this hideous war comes to an end?
    </p>
    <p>
      It is dangerous to prophesy, but, as far as we can judge, the least of the
      results will be that we shall all be poorer; that great fortunes will have
      diminished and vast enterprises disappeared; that what remains of our
      savings will have a different value; that some of us who thought we had
      earned our rest will have to go on working; that the industrial classes
      will have a time of privation; and that (most touching of human tragedies)
      the old and helpless and dependent among the very poor will more than ever
      feel themselves to be in the way, filling the beds and eating the bread of
      the children.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet none can say. It is one of the paradoxes of history that after the
      longest and most exhausting wars the accumulation of the largest national
      debts and the imposition of the heaviest taxations, nations have rapidly
      become rich. Although 1817 was a time of extreme distress in these
      islands, England prospered after the Napoleonic wars. Although 1871 was a
      time of fierce trial in Paris, yet France recovered herself quickly after
      the war with Germany. And though the Civil War in America left poverty in
      its immediate trail, the United States have since amassed boundless
      wealth.
    </p>
    <p>
      So do the nations, generation after generation, renew their strength even
      after the most prolonged campaigns. But beyond the economic loss there
      will in this case be the physical loss of ten millions, perhaps, of the
      young manhood of Europe dead, and ten other millions permanently disabled,
      with all the injury to the race thereby resulting; and beyond the physical
      loss there will be the intellectual loss in the ruthless destruction of
      those ancient monuments which had linked us with the past; and beyond the
      intellectual loss there will be the moral loss in the uprooting of that
      sympathy of nation with nation which had seemed to unite us with the
      future. As a consequence of this war a great part of Europe will be closed
      to some of us for the rest of our natural lives, and the world will
      contain more than a hundred millions fewer of our fellow-creatures in
      whose welfare we shall take joy.

    <h2>
      WAR&rsquo;S SPIRITUAL COMPENSATIONS
    </h2>
    <p>
      But, thank God, there is another side to the picture, both for young and
      old. If we are to be poorer we shall be more free. If we are to be weak
      and faint from loss of blood we shall rest at night without dread of that
      shadow of the sword which has darkened the sleep of humanity for forty
      years. If the countries of our enemies are to be closed to some of us in
      the future, the countries of our Allies will be more than ever open; nay,
      they will be almost the same to us as our own. France will be our France,
      Italy our Italy, Belgium our Belgium, and the next time I, for one, sit by
      the stove in the log cabin of a Russian moujik on the Steppes, I shall
      feel as if I were in the thatched cottage of one of my own people in our
      little island in the Irish Sea. So does blood shed in a common cause break
      down the barriers of race and language and bind together the children of
      one Father. The dead of our Allies become our dead, and our dead theirs.
      That Frenchman died to save my son; therefore he is my brother, and France
      is my country. &ldquo;One&rsquo;s country is the place where they lie whom we loved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus war, brutal, barbarous war, has its spiritual compensations, and pray
      heaven the present one may prove to have more than any other. If it does
      not, something will break in us after all we have gone through. Our faith
      in the invisible powers to bring a good end out of all this welter of
      blood and destruction has become a religion. It must not fail us if our
      souls are to live.

      LET US PRAY FOR VICTORY

    <p>
      &ldquo;It is good to pray for peace, but it is better to pray for justice. It is

      right, for the victory of human freedom.&rdquo; {*}

<pre xml:space="preserve">

    <p>
      Then let us pray for victory over our enemies, having no qualms, no shame,
      and no remorse. We know that Christ pronounced a death sentence on war,
      and that as soon as Christianity shall have established an ascendancy war
      will cease. But if anybody tells us in the meantime that by Christ&rsquo;s law
      we are to stand aside while a strong Power, which is in the wrong,
      inflicts frightful cruelties upon a weak Power which is in the right, let
      us answer that we simply don&rsquo;t believe it. If anybody tells us that by
      Christ&rsquo;s law we are to permit ourselves to be trodden upon and trampled
      out of being by an empire resting on violence, let us answer that we
      simply don&rsquo;t believe it. If anybody tells us that by Christ&rsquo;s law we are
      not to oppose the gigantic ambition of a &ldquo;War Lord&rdquo; who claims Divine
      right to stalk over Europe in scenes of blood, rapacity, and impurity, let
      us answer that we simply don&rsquo;t believe it. If anybody tells us that
      Christ&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;Resist not evil,&rdquo; were intended to say that spiritual
      forces will of themselves overcome all forms of war (including, as they
      needs must, crime, disease, and death) let us answer that we simply don&rsquo;t
      believe it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such a clumsy and dangerous interpretation of Christ&rsquo;s doctrine would put
      an end to government, to science, and to literature, and allow the worst
      elements of human nature to rule the world. It would also put Christianity
      on the scrap-heap&mdash;Christianity &ldquo;with its benevolent morality, its
      exquisite adaptation to the needs of human life, the consolation it brings
      to the house of mourning and the light with which it brightens the mystery
      of the grave.&rdquo; {*}

    <p>
      God forbid that the very least of us should say one word that would
      prolong the horrors of this terrible war. But it is just because we hate
      war that at the end of these 365 days we still think we must carry it on.
      It is just because our hearts are bleeding from the sacrifices we have
      made, and have still to make, that we feel they must be compelled to
      bleed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us, then, pray with all the fervour of our souls for Belgium, for
      Poland, for Italy, for Russia, for France, but above all, for our own
      beloved country, mother of nations, mother, too, of some of the bravest
      and best yet born on to the earth, that as long as there remains one man
      or woman of British blood above British soil this England and her Empire
      may be ours&mdash;ours and our children&rsquo;s.
